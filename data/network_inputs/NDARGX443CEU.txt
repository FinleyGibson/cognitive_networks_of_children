Maybe. Well ... There was a kid on a couch playing video games. And he got, his mom brought ... came in and put a box, which was his present on the table. He opened it and there was a dog but he was missing one of his front legs.                     So then he basically didn't like that, so he threw him on the floor. Kicked him away. But then after a couple of times, then the dog basically fell in the box and it made him laugh. So then he went out with the dog and then it appeared to be that he was missing a leg too.
 Not really. Well, the fact that he was missing a leg too. That he ditched the dog around. His mom. A dog. Playing video, video, video. A red ball. They both are missing a leg. Both. Happy. Happy, too. Good. Bad. Disgust. Okay. Sad. Mad. Okay. Good. Good. Okay.
