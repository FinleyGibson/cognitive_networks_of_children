I have, yeah. Well, in the beginning, there was a little boy. He was playing video games. He was sort of, he was really into it. His mother came in, gave him a present. He wasn't really interested until  ... why not. And then, he opened the present, it turned out to be a dog. He was excited about the dog until he realized that it had ... One leg was ... That the dog didn't have one leg. And he didn't like that so he threw the dog. But, the dog saw a ball and wanted to play with it. So the dog got the ball and tried to play with the ball, with the boy. But, the boy was dismissive. But, the dog continued to play with the ball and when the boy kicked the ball, he went after it. When the boy,  and the dog struggled getting the ball because he was missing a leg.                     But, when the boy realized that the dog was pretty persistent and didn't really give up, and still kept a good attitude, and wanted to keep playing, he gave the dog a chance. When he realized how persistent the dog was he went outside to go play with the dog and that's when you realize that the boy also has amputated leg. He goes outside to play with the dog. Yeah.
 Um.                     Well, the boy.
 I liked that it showed that no matter what physical hindrances you may have or what ever ... That ... I mean.                     Well, one thing about the movie is that he switched from being on the couch playing video games to like wanting to go, to going outside and being active. I like that it showed that even with disabilities, you can be active and do things that other normal people. Normal, well what ever normal is, that you're still normal even if you have certain disabilities. Yeah.
 I don't know. I didn't really dislike anything. His mother. A dog. Playing a video game. A ball. They both were missing a leg. How do you think the puppy was feeling? How do you think the boy was feeling? How did you feel when you watched this part? Cool, okay. Confused or I mean, the same. Upset, disappointed. Annoyed, a little bit. I guess. The same. Happy and-... Well, just hyper, excited. Annoyed. Sad for the puppy. Happy. More open. Like, open and ... Happy. I liked it. I thought it was cute.
