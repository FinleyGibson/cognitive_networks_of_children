No. In the beginning his mom came in with this box and he heard this squeak and he opened it and he saw a puppy. The puppy took the puppy out and he brought it in and noticed that he had one leg missing, and then the dog got the ball and he brought it and he kicked it, he got it, then the dog went into the box and was stuck in the box and it got out, and then he brings the ball to the human and he finally ... The human got off the  right to the human. No. That he finally got used to a dog and the x box. That he just left the dog hanging around when he wanted to play. The mom. Dog. Playing the electronic. A ball. Because the boy's missing one leg and the dog's missing one leg. Both. Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad when he through him. Mad. Sad. Playful. Mad. Like the dog was having fun. Happy. Happy. Happy.
