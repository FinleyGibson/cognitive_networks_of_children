In school. Alright. So what happened is the kid in the beginning, he only had ... Like he couldn't walk because he only had one leg. So he thought that he could just stay home and play on his video games, so that's what he did until his mom came home.                     His mom bring home a package and there was a dog, but at first he didn't really want to open the package because he was so stuck into his game. Then what happened was he ended up opening the package. He saw a dog, then what happened is that he saw the dog only had two legs but one paw. So then he thought, oh that dog wasn't like meant to be, so then he pushed the dog away ... but all the dog wanted to do was play. 
 No not really. In the end when he noticed that he had one leg and the dog only has a paw. He noticed that they're both the same. In the beginning when he kept on playing video games and he felt like he didn't have to do anything. He felt like he just didn't have to do anything, what anybody said. His mom. A dog. What was he doing before? He was playing video games. Hm? The ball. Because they're both missing a leg. Happy because he noticed that he actually had an owner. Maybe excited. I felt happy because the dog, he actually had an owner and nobody would take care of him. I think he felt like he was playing around maybe because he was still like, had his tongue out and it looked like he was smiling. Upset because the dog only had one paw, so he was upset about that. I felt upset because the boy, he just pushed the dog to the side. He still felt like he was playing. He still felt like he was playing around. Still upset because the dog, all he wanted to do was play but the boy, he didn't give any attention to the dog. Upset again because the boy, he just pushed him to the side and kept on playing his video games. Okay. Happy because now he noticed that he's actually giving him attention and now he's really playing with him. Maybe happy too because, and well surprised because he noticed that they both similar to each other. Happy because the boy, he actually recognized that the dog only had one leg so.
