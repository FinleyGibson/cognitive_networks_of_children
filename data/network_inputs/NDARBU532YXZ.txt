Not that I remember. Well, from what I could tell, since I didn't really have my glasses, so some of it was blurry, but a kid, who had walking issues didn't want to do anything. He just wanted to sit inside, play video games all day. So his mom brought home a puppy dog with a missing leg. The dog wanted to play with him. But the kid kept on just ignoring the dog. Then eventually, he warmed up to the dog a bit, and he took him outside. They played. He played with the dog, and then it ended. The kid was obsessed with video games, and he had some walking disability. I think it was a very cute idea of the kid with a walking issue, learning to get along with a dog that has a missing leg, since they're very much alike. The kid seemed kind of unnecessarily . He threw the dog. He was kind of disgusted by the fact that it had three legs. He was like, "Eww," and he threw it. The mom, or at least what I think was the mom. A puppy dog with three legs. Video games. A red ball. They both have leg disabilities. The puppy was missing a leg. Happy. Happy, excited. Amused, it was very light hearted, fun. The puppy still seemed very happy. Very grossed out, and annoyed, because he kind of originally was like, "Oh, my mom is doing this. Oh of course, she got me a dog that has three legs, because oh, I have a leg disability, yay." Annoyed that the boy just kind of threw the dog. The puppy seems to be happy, extremely excited. Very annoyed. Still mad at the boy, because he's literally just shoving, and ignoring a cute puppy with a missing leg. Oh, he was missing a leg. Very happy. Happy. Very satisfied.
