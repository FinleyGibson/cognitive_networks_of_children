No. Well I don't know who  got all of it of course. But what I did see, I saw, but I didn't know the kid had a ... he had one whole leg, and half of the other, and he had to use crutches. But I didn't know that at first, I thought he was just sitting down playing video games. Then the dog had the same thing, he had three, he has ... A dog that supposed to have four legs, but he only has three. And when he walks, he kind of stops, rolls over a little bit cause he only has three and a half basically. And not the whole, and not four whole legs. So they're just like each other.                     The boy didn't want to play with it, didn't want to play with him. Then he realized that he had the same problem that he had, so then they went outside and played fetch. 
 I remember that the mom brung the box down to Ted like is this for you? Then went upstairs. And the box had the dog in it. I liked that there was a dog included, cause I like dogs a lot. I like that the dog had the same disability that the boy had. So they both were in the same boat basically. Some of the things that I didn't like about the movie was when the boy didn't know that he had the same disability that he had, he kept kicking the dog over, and he kept ... He kicked the dog and that's not good. You shouldn't kick the dog even though you don't like it. So that's the part that I didn't really like. The mom gave the box to the boy. The dog. Playing video games. The ball. They both have, they both have one leg that's cut or that they don't have the paw, and they don't have the foot. They both have that basically the same. Excited, and happy. The boy said cool, so I feel like he felt like it was cool basically and he was happy and excited. I felt happy for the both of them. Basically he has a pet now, and they both before he didn't have anyone that's the same as him, and now he does. So now they have a happy. That the puppy felt sad I think, when he knocked him over. Mad, angry, upset. I felt sad that the boy knocked the dog over. Sad. How he tried again to play and all that, then he just kicked him over said, "Get lost." Aggravated, and annoyed. I felt like the dog was trying to work with him. But stay with him even though he knocked him over again. Knocked him over for and I feel  and I feel like the boy should have played with him before then. Excited and happy that the boy finally wanted to play with him. The boy was feeling like, happy I'd say. Happy and bled happy. He's feeling happy. I felt like, I felt happy watching this clip cause the boy actually wants to play with the dog. And that's good, so I felt happy.
