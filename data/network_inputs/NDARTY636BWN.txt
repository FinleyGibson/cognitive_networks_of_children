No. So, what had happened in the beginning was the kid, he was playing his video game, and his mom had came in late with a present for him, and it was a dog. And, he didn't like the dog, because he thought it was a video game. So, he was trying to make the dog go away. But, the dog kept following the ball, and he kept on kicking the ball. And then at the end, they had went out, they had got this pet, he had felt compassion for the dog. They went outside and played ball. To play with a rubber ball that he had, that the dog had found. Yes. No. The things that I liked about the movie was the child having compassion for the dog, and the way that, at the end, the way that he treated the dog. Some things that I did not like about the movie was, in the beginning, how he was treating his dog that his mom got him, and the way he reacted when he got it. His mother. A dog. He was playing video games. A rubber ball. They were both injured. They were both missing a leg. Both. Happy, excited. Excited. Happy. Good. A little bit happy, and a small bit excited. Disgust. Angry. Upset. I felt sad. Because he's judging the dog, just because he's missing a leg. A little bit happy, a little bit excited, but a small bit sad. Disgust. Angry. Sad. Happy. Excited. Happy. Excited. I felt happy.
