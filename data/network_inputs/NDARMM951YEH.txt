Yeah. No, I have not, even though I have seen a lot of shorts, like, little short movies at the end ... near the end of my summer break this year because I'm already at summer break. I mean, near the end of school, we watch bunches of shorts, but I have not seen that one. So at first, the boy was playing his video game when Mom came in and  a package. It was his present as in ... He was so focused on his video games that he didn't really open his present. But when he did, he saw a puppy. And he liked the puppy. Until he saw that he was missing a leg. Then he didn't like him anymore. And then he said, like, "Scram!" And then the puppy saw a ball. He went to go get it. And then he brought it over. He just kicked it back. Brought it back over again, kicked it back. And then the next part that I remember is that he got up ... he got up but then I realized that he was actually missing a leg too. And then I think that's all. I do not. That the boy was missing a leg and the dog was missing a leg. So they were actually alike, pretty alike. That the boy tossed the dog, because I love dogs. I have three dogs in my house. Two gigantic great danes and one little puppy. His mom. A three-legged puppy. Playing video games. The ball. I just told you, they're missing a leg. Happy! Happy! Happy. Sad. Mad. Kind of sad and mad because I do not like it when anyone throws dogs. Actually, he stayed happy most of the time but I think he was also a little sad. Mad like "mmph." Being bad to dogs, to be honest, I feel like I shouldn't have watched that clip.. Happy. Better because they do ... because they don't toss the dog anymore.
