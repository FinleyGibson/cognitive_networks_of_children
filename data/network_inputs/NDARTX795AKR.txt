No. So, the girls in the movie delivered girl scout cookies. And like ... Yeah. They both have dogs. Okay. So, at first the boy did not like his dog, but then he adjusted really quick.  play with the dog. And, that's all that I got to watch. There was no more. The MRI was over after that part. That there was a puppy, because I love puppies. Did not like that he didn't like the dog, because it's a puppy. Who doesn't like a cute puppy? I did not get to hear that part, because of the beeping. It was the dog. The minute he opened the box a dog just po, jumped out. He was playing video games, but I really want to see, because video games are my favorite thing in the world. Puppy was playing with, a red ball. And, he went outside to play catch since dogs are really good at catch. They both have one leg that isn't entirely a leg. Okay. He was really happy. Happy too. I felt like I was, like I had the puppy. Puppy was feeling really sad. The boy was feeling upset. Because, he wanted the puppy to have all four legs. I felt like I, I felt like, if this actually happened with a boy in real life. That I saw, I'd be super sad. Puppy was feeling more sad. The boy was feeling very, very upset. I felt like, he was trying to concentrate on his video game and I really want to see it. Told you. Awesome. Boy was feeling super happy. I felt like, if I had a puppy, I would like him to, I would still want him to have four legs.
