No, I haven't seen it before. So, what happened in the beginning was that the boy was playing the game, and then his mom came and got a present for him. And the present was a dog. And in the middle, he didn't like it. But, in the end he did like it. Also, in the middle, he threw the ball in the ... the boy threw the ball in the box, so the dog could go in the box, and then the dog got out the box. That at the end, the teenager boy and the dog was gonna play, was gonna be outside. That the teenager boy didn't like the dog. His mom. A puppy. When he opened the box? What he was doing? He was opening it up. He didn't wanna open it now. The puppy was playing with the red, the dog ball. They like each other. Okay. Yes. The puppy was feeling happy, since he saw the teenaged boy. The boy was feeling happy, too. I felt happy, too. A bit sad. Angry. A little nervous. Still a little, still happy. He got angry, and he told the dog to get lost. What I felt when I watched the clip, was I felt the same as the teenage boy. Happy. Happy, that time. Happy.
