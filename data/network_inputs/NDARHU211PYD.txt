Yup.  Oh. He played a game. Then his mother came home. Then he opened his present. Then it was like a lost puppy with three legs. That's how ... So he got outside and threw the ball. Okay. Nah. the rest of it. I liked it. Despicable Me. It was so good. He turned his leg into a balloon. No. Like he had a lost leg, but then what happens when the lost leg comes back. The boy wrapped up his leg. The mom. A puppy. He was open it. Playing video game. The ball. Because he had the legs. Okay. Happy. Happy. Happy. I'm done. That was my last one. Bad. Bad, didn't want the puppy. Happy. Yeah. He rolled over. I feel happy. Sad. Angry. Sad. No, no. That's my last part. Happy. Happy. Weird. Because his leg was up. It was like loss of leg. He had one leg left.
