No. What is it called? The guy was playing video games and all he wanted to do was play video games. A box was on him, then he opened the box, and then it was dog. The dog wanted to play ball, and he gave the ball and he kicked it once, and then the dog gave it back. Then he went outside with the dog. No. What movie? I didn't really like anything about it. Everything. Everything. I don't think it was a good commercial. I just didn't. I don't have any reason. His mom. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. 'Cause they both liked to play with one thing. The same? Happy. Happy. It was okay. Mm-hmm (affirmative). Angry. Sad. Happy. Sad. Angry, sad. Sad. Sad. Angry at the puppy. Angry at the guy. Really happy, and the boy. Really happy. Happy.
