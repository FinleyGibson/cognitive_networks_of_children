Despicable Me? I think I might have seen it. No, I haven't seen it. I saw a kid getting a present and then he went to play fetch with his dog. That's really all I saw because I didn't really see the whole movie. No I was watching a different movie. Oh, yeah, that's what I saw. I saw that kid was playing a video game, then his mom gets him a present and he realizes that the dog only has three legs and he gets mad and goes back to playing video games. At the end he plays fetch with his dog and it's revealed that he only has one leg. No. Not really. I mean, I guess it's kind of fun. There's not a lot of movies about disabled people so that's a plus. And I do like dogs so that's also a plus. It's just kind of a weird thing but maybe I think some people could get offended about disabled people or something. I'm not really sure. The mom. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. They are both disabled. Happy. Happy as well. It kind of felt like kind of nostalgic because when me and my puppy got a dog, we went to the pet shop to buy it. It was a weird feeling I guess. Sad. Mad. I kind of felt like the boy was angry at the dog because he got a dog that only had three feet instead of four. So I kind of didn't know what to feel. I guess I just don't really have a feeling on it. It was just, it wasn't really a part that I could understand. Rejected. Annoyed. I kind of felt bad for the dog. It kept getting kicked by the owner. Happy. Happy. I thought it was cute. I felt happy that the boy could love his dog.
