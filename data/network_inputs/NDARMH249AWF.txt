He was playing video games and his mom came home with this box and put it right in front of him. And I guess he didn't want to see it because he was too focused on the video game. Then after that he opened it up real quick when she went up the stairs and a dog popped out. He seemed excited to see it until he saw that it was missing a leg. He put it down and stared kicking it to the side. After that the dog started going after the red ball, started running around and it caught his attention. Right then, he thought it was finally funny so he got up. I thought he had both his legs but he got up he was missing half of his other leg. They went outside and from there they just started playing. At the end, where they got along after. When he was kicking the dog aside. His mom. A dog. Playing video games. The red ball. They were both missing ... well he was missing a part of his leg and the dog was missing a part of his leg. Excited to have a new owner? He was excited. I felt good. I think he was feeling a little excited until he got dropped to the floor by the boy. He didn't want the dog because he didn't have no arm. Aggravated. He was trying to get his attention and then when he kicked him the puppy felt like he didn't want him. The owner ... the boy didn't want the dog around. Mad or he didn't want the dog around at all. Aggravated. Happy that somebody finally wanted him. He was happy that he finally ... I guess there was something more similar to him so they were both happy. Good.
