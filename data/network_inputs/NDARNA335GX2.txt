It's like a real microphone. No. I mean I may remember one. That he kicked it. I don't know. He was playing games. And then he opened a box. Then the puppy jumped out. And then he picked up the puppy. Then he played fetch with the puppy. Then he said ewww, and then he, and then the puppy come back, and then he kicked the puppy. And then he played fetch with the puppy outside. That's it. I liked when the puppy jumped out. I did not like when he kicked the puppy. His mom. A puppy. Huh? No, I said the mom got the box. He was still playing games and then he opened it. A ball. Umm. Yeah. That they knock the both sides and they both don't look like a dog or a human. I mean like the human don't look like a dog or the dog don't look like a human. Neither. Okay. Happy. Mad. I mean sad. A little sad. He was too happy. Mad. I was feeling a little sad. He was a little sad. Mad. I was feeling like the puppy. Okay. Happy. I think he was feeling happy too, because I really didn't saw the face. A little happy. And it made me cry. Because that was the sad part.
