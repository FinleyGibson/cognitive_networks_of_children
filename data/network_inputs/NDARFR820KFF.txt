Then he opened up the box. He saw a dog, and he played with it. Then he smelled something bad. Then he dropped the dog. After that, whenever the dog tried to play with him, he kicked it away. Then he kicked it away again. Then after that, the dog found the red ball. The dog was hitting the ball. Then it went into the box. Then the dog hit it out of the box. Then the boy that was playing his video game, he got up, and he was actually paralyzed. He got one of his feet amputated. Then he was playing catch with the dog. He was playing a shooting game. He was playing a video game. His foot was amputated. The mom. A dog. Playing his shooting game. The red ball. They both, at the end, were playing The boy. Happy. Excited. Excited. Sad that whenever he threw the puppy, whenever the boy threw him. Disgusted of how it smelled, or something. I was kind of mad at the kid for throwing the puppy. Sad. Fed up. A little angry, but a little sad. Happy. Happy. I felt better that they got along.
