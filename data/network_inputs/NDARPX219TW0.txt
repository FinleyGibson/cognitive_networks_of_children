Yeah. Okay. A boy was playing video games and his mother brought him a gift and it was a dog that was missing a foot. At first, he was like "Oh, I don't want it cause it's missing a foot." And then he watched the dog play with a ball and he started to like the dog so he decided to go outside. It showed that he was also missing a foot or like half a leg, I guess. No. The message. I don't know. Nothing really. It was fine. The mother. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. They were both amputees. Yeah. Excited. Also, excited. I'd seen it before so it was kind of ... I don't know. I mean, I knew it was gonna happen. So. Kind of confused. Annoyed. Kind of annoyed. Also, confused. I think it's the same as last clip. Same thing. Sort of like ... I don't know. Angry. Still annoyed. Happy. Also, happy. Same thing. Yeah.
