I think so. All right. In the beginning of the movie, a mom bought his son a present but he at first, he was distracted by technologies, and wasn't interested. But when the blinds opened, he couldn't see and had to stop and then use that time to open the present and got a dog, which at first he didn't like, but after discovering what it was like, he eventually liked it and then started to go outside and play with it. They both had physical disabilities. The present. Yeah. I did not like that they couldn't walk very well. His mom. A dog. Playing video games. A box and then a ball. They both have legs cut off. We're watching it again? Happy. Excited. Can we watch it again? Happy. Can I see it again? Upset. Angry. I was upset. Rejected. Annoyed. Sad. Happy. Can I see it again? Happy. Happy.
