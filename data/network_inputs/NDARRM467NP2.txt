What one? No. The mom said, "Go outside. It's a beautiful day." And then she gave him a package and she said "Open it." And then he opened it and it was a puppy inside and he didn't really like the puppy. And then he started to like the puppy and then they went outside. I don't know. Nothing cause I didn't like anything. Didn't like the whole movie. The mom. A puppy. Playing video games. The red ball. I don't know. Okay. Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad. Upset. I don't know. Sad. Upset, again. I don't know. Happy. Happy. I don't know.
