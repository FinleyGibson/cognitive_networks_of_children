Yeah. So a kid, he was playing video games and then his mom came in with a box. And then she said "Get off the video game and open the box".  And then he opened it and then he saw it was a dog. And then he realized he didn't have a leg. And then he was mean to it. And then the dog went to find the ball under the stove, I think. No, it was like, something else. But he went to find it and then he was playing with it. And then the boy realized that he liked the ball and then he got stuck under the box and he flipped it over. And then the boy realized that he liked the dog. And then the boy got up and then they had something in common. No. I liked the ending when they liked each other. That the kid was mean to the dog. His mom. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. They don't have legs. Both of them. Okay. Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad. Mad. I would say, kind of sad too. Sad. Mad. Sad also. Happy. Happy. Happy.
