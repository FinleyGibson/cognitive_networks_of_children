Yes. The boy first is playing video games, and then the Mom came in and brought him a dog, and found out that he had no leg, and so he was grumpy at first, but then he liked the dog. He didn't have a leg too. And then, they played fetch. He had to wear crutches, and that's about it. The puppy was pretty cute. Kind of gross, at first, when he found out that it didn't have a leg. His mom. The puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They both were missing a leg. Happy. Kind of happy. I don't know. A little dejected. Grossed out. I don't know. Kind of bored. Anxious to play with the ball. Annoyed. Kind of annoyed. Happy. Happy. I don't know.
