No. In the beginning, he was playing video games and his mom came in and put a box right in front of him and he told his mom to move and then after a while, he opened up the box and the dog came up. He picked up the dog and then he saw that it only had three legs, so he put the dog down and he didn't want the dog and then he kicked the dog. And then the dog found a ball and then he bought the ball to the kid. Then the kid kicked the ball so the dog ran after it. And then he tried to find it but the guy kicked it into a box and the dog went into the box and then he got stuck in the box. And then he figured out his way and the guy thought that was funny. So he took the dog outside and he started playing with it. The guy only had one leg. He had one and a half leg. The doggy. He was mean to the doggy at first. His mom. A dog. Playing video games. A ball, a red ball. They're both missing a part of their leg. Mm-hmm (affirmative). Happy. Happy too. That part, I said that the dog was cute. Sad. Mad. Sad. Playful. Annoyed. Sad still. Happy. Happy. Happy.
