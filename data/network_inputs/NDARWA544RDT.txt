I'm not sure if I have seen Minions before. I've heard about it. I'm not sure if I've heard about the puppy movie. The puppy was playing with the ball right when the boy video game and the boy got the present. No. I'm not sure. I'm not sure either. His mom. A puppy. Playing the TV game. A ball. They both talked. The boy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Mad. Happy. Happy. Mad. Happy. Why is the boy missing a leg? Why is the boy missing a leg? Happy. Happy. Happy.
