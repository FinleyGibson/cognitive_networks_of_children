The puppy interview? Yeah. I saw it, like a couple of time. Like, my mom was on Facebook or something, and she saw this very cute puppy video, so she showed it to me. So, it was about this boy playing video games, and his mom gave her a puppy that was in an accident, or was born with something wrong with it. And, it only had three legs, because it lost its fourth leg. And, the boy didn't want a puppy that was weird. But, then at the end of the video, it showed that the boy lost his leg, too, probably in an accident, or like, he was born like that. The puppy wanted to play with him. But he didn't. That it's okay to be yourself. To tell you truth, that'd be like the lost body parts or something. The mom. A puppy with three legs, only. Playing video games, like, Call of Duty, or something. A ball. Because they both lost a leg. Both. Happy. Well, at first he was happy until he- Happy. That they thought that he was gonna accept the puppy through the whole entire video. . A little bit sad. Disappointed. I would say animal cruelty, like, animal abuse, because you don't just throw a puppy, that's abusive. Kinda positive to get the boy to look at him. Angry and disappointed. That I think he's still doing a bit of abusing, because he's, like, kicking the puppy, and you're not supposed to do that. Happy. Proud. I feel, like a bit proud, because the boy was proud that someone else is like him.
