What movie? Oh. Yeah, but I never seen like the middle of it. Before when the mom was not there, the boy was playing video games all the time. And when he was not there, she brung in a box and then when you opened the box, there was a dog with three legs in there. And then when he saw he was missing a leg, he said "Ew" and then he just threw him on the floor. And then when the dog came close to him, he kicked him. And then when the dog saw the ball, he gave him the ball and then he kicked the ball and then he picked it up and then he told his mom that he was going to go outside. That he started to like him. At the beginning that he didn't like him and then he started to have a personality that he had. When he kicked the dog. The mom. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. They're both missing a leg. Mm-hmm (affirmative) Happy. Happy until he saw he was missing a leg. I don't know. A little sad. Hungry. A little sad. A little sadder. Mad. A little sad. Happy. Happy. Happy.
