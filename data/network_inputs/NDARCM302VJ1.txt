Yeah, the first one, Despicable Me? Oh, the last one? No, I haven't. There was this boy who loves to play video games. But, the thing is, he doesn't have a leg, a proper leg, full leg. And the mother got ... Once she arrived, the mother got the boy a present, a gift. And it was a dog, but he also didn't have a front paw. So, the boy was kinda disgust at first, and he started to kick it around. He's like, "Get away from me." But then after that, he starts to realize that it was actually all right. It was like ... It was nice. So then, he started to play with the dog, and he finally went outside like his mother asked him to. So, he started playing with the dog. Yeah, I pretty much summed it up, I guess. The ending because at first, I was kinda disgust because he started kicking the dog. I'm like, come on, it's a life. It's something that you should appreciate. Not most people have pets, so, yeah. That he was mistreating the dog because he thought it was, like, useless or something. The mother did. It was a small puppy with a missing front paw. He was mostly interact with his video games. A red ball. Because they both don't have a leg. Okay. He was pretty excited. He was glad. He probably felt glad too that he got a puppy. I felt kind of ... It felt calming. It felt nice to actually see that they're both happy. He felt a bit confused, I guess. He felt angry. I felt kind of angry too, not at the puppy, but at the boy. He still, like, liked the boy, so he kept trying to get his attention, I'm assuming. Like he wanted to get rid of it. Like I said, I was kinda angry. He felt kinda overjoyed because now the boy appreciated him. He appreciate the dog. I feel kinda happy. It was cute.
