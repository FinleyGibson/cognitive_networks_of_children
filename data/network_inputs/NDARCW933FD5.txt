Yeah. At the Child Mind Institute, the building, they put this weird sticky cap on my head and I had to watch that. Okay. So the boy, he's playing video games. And then his mom comes home and brings him a present and he opens the present and it's a dog that has lost one of its legs. And the boy doesn't really like it because it's lost one of its legs, so it's like, "Ew, go away. Get away from me." So the dog finds a bone and starts playing with it and then he kind of grows on the boy and so he starts playing with the ball a lot and the boy starts smiling. And then the boy takes the ball and he tells his mom he's going to go outside and you find out that he also lost part of his leg, like the dog. And then they go outside and play. Yeah, he was playing a game that involved a lot of moaning because the video game moaning a lot. I kind of liked where the mom gave him the present. When she said, "Why don't you open up the present that I gave you?" And when she opened up the blinds and he's like, "Meh" because he couldn't really see the light. I didn't like how the boy was so mean to the dog when he knew that he was like the dog. He also lost part of his leg, so it's like why are you being so rude? He's a lot like you. The mom. A puppy. Playing video games. The ball. They both have lost part of their leg. Very happy because he might have felt finally appreciated. Happy because he had someone to play with, maybe. I felt happy for the boy and the dog because they had companions to hang out with now. Very hurt, mentally and physically. Upset. Very mad at the boy. A little hurt, but ... Still pretty upset. Really mad at the boy. Puppy was feeling really really happy and finally appreciated. Happy to have a companion that's like him. My heart just bloomed with happiness.
