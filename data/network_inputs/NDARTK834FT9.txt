No. Okay. The boy was playing a video game, and the mom came home and put a box on the table. The boy was angry that she interrupted him and nudged it out of the way angrily. And then the boy opened the box when the mom prompted him. He took the puppy out, but threw it on the floor. And the dog went over and found a ball under a table and played with it alone. It went over to the boy, but the boy was still angry because he wanted to play the video game. And then I guess they went outside, but the boy was on crutches and didn't have a leg. Not really. I'm not sure. I guess that the mom had a gift for the boy and that she went out of her way to get a gift. That the boy threw the dog on the ground. That's just animal abuse. The mom. The puppy. Playing video games. The ball. They're living things. The boy? Okay. Excited to see the boy. Excited to see the puppy. I thought that the boy was excited, but then threw it on the ground. So, I don't know. I was torn. Rejected. I think the boy felt ... I don't know how to put it into words, but I think kind of ... I don't know how to put it into words. Trivialized? I didn't notice that the dog didn't have a paw the first time. Yeah. Also still rejected. Angry. Still angry. I don't know, I guess ... I don't know. Happy? Happy, too. Better.
