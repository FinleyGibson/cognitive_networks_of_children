Yes. What, the puppy? I never seen that movie before. I thought you meant Despicable Me 3. He was playing video games, and, then, his mom got a present for him. He opened the present. It was a puppy, but the puppy was missing a leg, like a paw. Then, he started being ... He acted mean to the puppy at first cuz he kicked it and said, "Get lost." Then, the puppy found a red ball, and he threw the ball for the puppy, so the puppy would go away, but then it went into a box and started playing around in the box. Then, he thought the puppy would be a good pet. He went outside with the puppy. He lost a leg too, so they were playing fetch outside. He wanted to stay inside and not go out, but the puppy changed that, so he would go out. I liked that- That they lost a leg. His mom. A puppy. Playing video games. A red ball. The both lost a leg. Happy. Happy. Happy too. Angry. No, the puppy was feeling scared. The boy was feeling angry. Mad at the boy. Sad and alone. Angry. Angry and sad. Happy. Happy. Happy.
