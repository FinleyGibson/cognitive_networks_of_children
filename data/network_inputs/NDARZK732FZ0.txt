No. Well there's two movies though. Which one? Wait, what's the question? What's the question? Oh well, a kid, he got a dog with one leg. And he was like disappointed and didn't want it, because it was like disabled. And it started wanting to play with him, and he kept like banging the stuff, and eventually he felt bad. So, he decided to start playing with him, and turns out he also had one leg, too. So ... I guess that's what happened. No. It was like pretty short. Like, wasn't it five minutes? What I liked? ... I guess I like the dog. Because he was like ... I don't know, just like a little ... I didn't really like the kid that much, cause he was like rejecting the dog, and he was like being kinda mean to it. So I didn't like that. His mom. The dog. He was playing video games. A ball. Well they both are missing a body part. Okay. I think he was feeling happy, because he's finally out of the box. And he has like a family. Well he was happy too, when he saw the dog. I guess kinda happy. Well, like sad because he just threw him on the floor, so ... He was kinda angry, because the dog is missing a leg. A little bit angry, cause he just threw a dog on the floor, so ... I guess still sad, cause he just got kicked. He's getting annoyed at the dog. Kinda like angry at the kid, cause he kicked the dog, and yeah ... Happy cause he's finally playing with him? I guess he's finally like ... He kinda like feels bad for the dog because like they're both missing a body part, and he can like kinda relate. So ... Pity I guess? I was like kinda surprised, cause I didn't know he was missing a leg, and I guess happy for them.
