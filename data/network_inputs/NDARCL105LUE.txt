The goodness. And the ending had the goodness. He saw the puppy in a box. He found a puppy in a box. And then he looked at the puppy and thought he was gonna play with it, and then put it down, and then put it down. And keep throwing the ball for him, and then they went out the house. No. Is when he first found the puppy and he wanted to play with it. When he was frowning at the puppy. His mother. The puppy. Playing a video game. A ball. They were both were playing something. Okay. Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad. Angry. Sad. Sad. Angry still because he didn't like what the puppy was doing. Sad. I like that part. Happy. Happy. Happy.
