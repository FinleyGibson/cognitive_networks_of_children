Yeah. I saw it before at the institute. In the beginning, the kids was playing the Xbox 360. His mom came in and gave him a package, and he didn't care about it until then he opened it. Then when he opened it, it was a dog, but only had three legs. Then he threw the dog and the dog was upside down in front of the ball. Then the boy kicked the ball into the box and the dog got stuck in the box for like three second then got out. Then he picked up the ball, put it in his pocket and then went outside. No. That it had a dog in it. Nothing really. His mom. A dog or a puppy. Playing the Xbox. The ball. They both lost a leg. Okay. Happy. Happy too. Happy. Still a little happy. Disgust and angry. Sad. Happy. Still angry. Still sad. Happy and hyper. Happy. Happy.
