That his mom gave him a present and it was a dog so... he didn't want the dog and at the end of the day, at the end of the story he wanted the dog and he wanted to go outside. Not really. The video game. The rest. I'm just kidding. His mom. All right. Dog. Playing his game. A red ball. They have a missing leg. Both. Excited. Excited, bored then he wanted to play with him at the end of the clip. Nothing. Still excited. Not that great because the dog has a missing leg. Nothing. Bored. Nothing. Excited. Great. Nothing!
