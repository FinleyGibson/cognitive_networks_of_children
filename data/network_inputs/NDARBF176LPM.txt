No. So, the kid was playing video games on the couch, and his mom came in with the box. And his mom told him to open the box because it was a present. And so, for a while he acted like the box wasn't there but then he opened it and there was the puppy. And then he saw it had three legs and started to ignore it. And the puppy started wandering about the house, and the kid frantically changed from watching the game to the puppy, until it was just the puppy. And then he was staring at the puppy who had the ball at his legs. And finally, the clip shows a picture of his legs, showing that he's missing a leg as well, and they went outside. Not much. I can't say. I can't say either. The mom. The puppy. Playing video games. The ball. They're both missing a leg. Happy. Happy as well. Not so good. Not so good. I can't say it. Sad. Mad.  Happy. Happy. Happy.
