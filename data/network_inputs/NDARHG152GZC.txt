No. In the beginning he was home alone I guess a lot, and then his mom got him a present, and it was a puppy with three legs. He didn't want him, he didn't want nothing to do with him, after he saw that he had three legs, and then at the end of the movie he liked him, and then I realized after he got up that he had one leg, too. It was very inspirational. (silence) I thought it was cute. It showed there's always someone out there for someone. There was nothing I didn't like about it. His mom. A puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They both had traumatic experience in their life, if they lost something. Both. Okay. Happy that he really got a person to call his own. He was happy but then his facial reaction changed when he saw the puppy had three legs. It made me feel like I'm grateful. I have all my body part that I did. He got mad at it. Upset. Mad. It was kind of sad. Sad. Mad. Mad. Happy. Happy, like they finally connected together. I mean, I was grateful that he played with him. I know it's a movie, but ... Both.
