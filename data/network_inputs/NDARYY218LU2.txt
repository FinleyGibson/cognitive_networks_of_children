No. I don't really know. Oh. This boy was playing a game. He had a present, so he opened it. It was a dog. He had three feet, and four legs, so he kicked him away. Then he was getting a ball. When he kicked the ball away, the dog got it. Then they were playing outside. Then they went outside to play. That's all. When the dog got the ball. When the kid kicked the ball away. Their mom. A dog. Playing a video game. A ball. Because they both didn't have feet. Neither. Happy. A little happy. Happy. Well, a little upset, and a little excited. Well, a little nervous. A little nervous too. Well, still felt the same thing. Well, he wanted to focus on his thing he was doing. Happy. Happy. Happy too. Excited. Both.
