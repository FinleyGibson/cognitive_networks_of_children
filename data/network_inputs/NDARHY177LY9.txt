No. Well first, the boy's mom came home while he was playing video games. She put a box in front of him. He just kept playing until his mom said that it was for him. Then after, he opened it, and found a dog in there. At first, he thought it was cool, but then he noticed that the dog was missing part of its front leg. At first the boy didn't really care, but then a few minutes later, he got used to it. Then he went outside with the dog, and started to play with it. Not exactly. I like that he actually started to pay attention to the dog at the end. That at first he didn't even care that he got a dog. His mom. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. They were both missing part of their leg. Yeah. I can't hear it. Happy. Happy. I kind of felt surprised to see a dog in a box. Maybe hurt. Mad. Well, I felt sad, because he threw the dog on the floor. I don't know. Annoyed, maybe. I felt sad, because he was rejecting the dog. Happy. Good. I felt good, because he finally started paying attention to the dog.
