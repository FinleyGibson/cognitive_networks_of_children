Mm-mm (negative), mm-mm (negative). What happened in it is ... the boy fell in a Egypt thing and ... Oh. It was about his mom bought him a dog and with no arm because he didn't have a leg. He probably didn't want him to get made fun of so she bought him a dog without an arm. So then he didn't ... he didn't like it, but then he saw him playing around and being funny but, and then they went out to play. That ... I don't know. I like everything. I didn't like ... No, I liked everything so then ... I disliked is ... I disliked is ... I didn't dislike nothin'. Hm? What do you mean? Mm-hmm (affirmative). His mom. A puppy. Playing Xbox. The ball. Because they both don't have one of their body parts. But it's the same thing. Happy. Not happy because he recognized that the puppy didn't have an arm. I felt ... no feeling. Mad. He was feeling upset. I mean the puppy was still feeling happy but the boy was feeling upset. I felt that was not nice. That's how I felt. Teased? Upset still. Still no feeling. I think they both felt really happy. Happy. Happy. Happy.
