The beginning of the story, the kid was playing video games. His mom came in and he was ... his mom told him to open the present that she got him. When he opened it, he saw a dog. The dog was kind of ... When he was running he kept falling and looked like he only had three legs. After the dog wanted to play with him with the ball he had, the red ball the dog had, he got up and he had crutches. When he got up they went to go play outside, and he told his mom that they were going to play outside. Then they started to go outside and they were playing fetch. I don't know. Nothing really. His mom. A dog. Playing video games. A red ball. They both ... they couldn't really walk perfectly. Okay. Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad. Mad. Sad. Sad. Mad. Sad. Happy. Happy. Happy.
