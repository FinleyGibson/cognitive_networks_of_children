No. What's that? No. I don't know the middle, or the end. I remember that at first he was playing a video game, and then her Mom said something. I don't remember. It was something like .                     It's not what happens in the movie, but that's the noisiness from the MRI thingy?
 Her Mom, like, put a box there, and when she opened it, it was like  a dog that came out. And then, dog landed on the floor, and I think he did something, like, he licked him the first time, or something, but then like he, like went on his leg, or something, I mean like went like that, and he's like get off, and that happened like a few times, or something happened, and he's like get off, or he's like . And then, like, soon after that, he got up, and we figured out that half of his leg is missing, I think. Like, or his ear, some of it. And then, he like had these things, and he went outside, and he threw the ball a little bit. That's what I remember. I don't think so. Well, I thought it was cool to be about that dog, and then ... I knew that. It was just a ball that he, like, threw sometimes, a little bit, and the dog tried to get it. Well, is there supposed ... I don't know the movie, like, you stopped it at the beginning. Like, I don't know the whole movie so like ... That was? No, that was the end of the movie, when I saw that. I like that story. Yeah. No. I just don't feel like that boy was so nice to the dog. The mom. The dog. Playing video games. The ball. They both like to play something else. Happy. Happy too. I don't know. Can we watch it again? I wasn't really focusing. I feel like he's happy. Happy too. Happy. I'm not supposed to feel anything. I don't get it, like, how do you feel happy?                     Like, you feel happy, yeah, you're happy, but from watching a movie? Like, it can sometimes make you happy, but like it's not like the happy, happy, kind of happy. It makes you feel like ... Aww. That's sweet. That kind of happy.
 Okay. Sad, a little bit, when he dropped him off. Ewww. That's disgusting. I feel like the boy wasn't being nice. Sad. Like, get off of me. Why are you bothering me? I feel like the boy wasn't being nice. Happy. Like, it was a good puppy, or happy too. I was feeling like the boy's a good boy, a little bit.
