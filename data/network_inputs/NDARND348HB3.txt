No. So, this boy was so stuck on this video game and he wouldn't want to go outside. First, I didn't know what they were actually doing, why he was not going outside to do it. Then, his mom got him a present and he opened it, there's a little puppy. He was so happy, then he like, "Ew, a puppy." Then, he kicked the ball cause then the little puppy saw the ball. Then, got it. He kept on , he was a very clumsy puppy though. He's like tripping and falling. He kicked the ball into the box and he got stuck in the box. Then, he came out. I think that he was ... then he started to have fun. Then, he got off his video game and I found out he had crutches cause he lost his leg. He went out to play with his puppy. No. I liked that he got a puppy cause I really want my own puppy. Even though we already have a dog, I want a puppy of my own. Like a tea-cup puppy. So, I liked that part. And, it was kind of nice of his mom to buy him a puppy even though he always played video games inside. I didn't like that he was so mean to the puppy. The mom. A puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They're both, they're both ... one is ... they both had that red ball once. That's all, I think. Okay. Happy. Happy. Excited. What's gonna happen next. He's feeling like, sad because he threw him on the floor. Disgust. Because, he saw that the puppy was drooling. And he was like, "Gross." I felt sad for the puppy. Very sad. Like, that puppy is the least thing I want in the world right now. Very, mostly sad for the little puppy. I felt very angry at the boy for doing that, cause I'd rather have that puppy. Very happy. Happy. I feel happy for both of them. But then, I noticed he lost his leg. And I was like, "Why did he, how did he lose his leg?"
