No. I don't remember. Well, the kid has a lost leg. He was walking with only one leg, and he was holding something. And he was playing with his pet dog. I don't know. I remember - I think the daddy was trying to get the thing, so he could shrink them to small. The guys were squeezing. And the daddy said, "I hate that guy". I just liked the end of the movie. The part when he had a loose leg. Not the whole movie. Just the end. The mother. A dog. He tried to open it, but his mother put a box, and the kid was still playing some game, and he couldn't pay attention to the box. Then put his controller and paused the game, and he took it out. When he took the doggy out, he didn't care. A ball. I don't understand that question? Well... What do "similar" means? They're not the same way. A doggy has four legs. A human has two legs. Yeah, and he didn't have no leg. He just had one. Yep. I already saw that part. I know he has a broken leg. Yeah - no, not him. The guy - the kid with the broken leg. I saw that part. He wasn't feeling happy. He thought he was gonna play with him, he was playing him outside. And the kid said, "Mother, we're gonna be outside." That's what he said. He was happy for a second. He was playing a game. He kicked the ball. The doggy was sad because he couldn't play with him. I feel happy about the last part. Wait, that was the minion movie? I saw the minion movie. Then it was the movie of the dog and the boy. That was it, just the end was the dog and the boy. Okay I know he doesn't like those tongues about that. I think he was feeling happy. Well... the doggy wanted the kid to rub his belly. So... Well... he didn't like his tongue. And the doggy was still happy. He got sad because he didn't do nothing to him. That's why the doggy was sad. I feel happy. Told you he didn't pay attention. He doesn't like no doggy. I think he was feeling really sad. Well, he was feeling bored. Happy about that part. I knew it, he was playing with the doggy outside. I knew it. How did he got a broken leg? Why that was just the end of the dog and the boy? That was it, just that? So it was minions, then it was the dog and the boy, then I just saw the picture of the box? Well the doggy was feeling happy. And the boy liked to play with him. Yeah. Feel happy about that part. I like the part when he was playing with him.
