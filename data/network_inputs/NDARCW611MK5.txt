No I haven't. Yeah. There was a boy. He was playing video game. He seemed very into them. Very interested, and hardly paying attention to the real world. His mom comes home, and tells him he has a present, and gives him a box. He just keeps on playing the video games and ignores it. Then a little bit later he gets curious. He puts down the video controller, and opens the box, and out comes a puppy. The puppy tries to lick him. He wants to play. He ignores the puppy for a little while, and then gives in to playing with the dog a bit. He starts playing with him a little bit more, little by little. Then he goes outside with the dog, and starts playing more. I don't know. I mean, I could probably put in a ton more details, but ... It's a nice movie. I don't know how to explain it. It's got ... I don't know. Well, not really much. I mean the character, the boy in it, it wasn't nice of him to just play video games while the dog was trying to play. But I liked the movie. I don't think there was much to dislike about it. His mother. A puppy. Well, most likely playing video games. The ball. The red ball he found under the counter. They both like to play. Happy, excited. Happy, and excited too. - I don't know. I think it was a nice, exciting part of the film. Probably still a little bit excited, knowing puppies. But also a little bit sad, because the boy threw him on the floor. If I was thinking about how he was feeling, I don't know, he was probably a little disgusted the dog was trying to lick him. But he's probably also a little  bit happy, and excited about the dog. - Kind of sad that he threw the dog on the floor. Kind of sad again. Annoyed that the dog was trying to play. I felt bummed for the dog. Happy, excited. Probably happy too. Happy.
