No. There was a kid playing an X-box and his mom was at the door with a giant box and then the mom took the box and put it right in front of the teenager and the teenager opened it, and it was a little puppy that had a lost leg and he didn't really care about it, so he just threw him on the floor, and the puppy seen this ball was red and then he wanted to play, but the teenager didn't even want to play since he was too busy playing the X-box. After a little while, he started wanting to play and then he asked his mom if he can go outside and then his mom said yes. And they just started playing. No, that was all. The little puppy. The rest. Just when the puppy came, and I thought that was just something else. The mom. The puppy. What? Playing. With his electronics. What? The ball. Because they both have lost legs. Happy. Happy. No, he was being sarcastic. I was like, I didn't even know, I thought he was just happy and stuff. But all of a sudden, he just started getting off. Yep. I knew it. And then he threw the box on the floor. What? Because the teenager was holding the puppy and then threw him on the floor. Still happy. off, again. Sad. He kicked him. Still happy. Still off. Same as the same question as before. The same question before. Okay. Still happy. Now happy. Happy.
