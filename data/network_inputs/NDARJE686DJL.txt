No. In the beginning, he was playing video games and then his mom came. He got the present. And she put the present, he was like trying to do that. Then he opened the present. Then the dog was there. Then he picked up the dog and he threw it to the floor because he had only three legs. Then the dog saw the ball and started playing and then the guy kicked it and tried to get it. And then he turned his leg just like the dogs and then they went outside to play fetch together. No. They got along. That the dog looks weird because it has only three legs. The mom. The dog. Playing video games. The red ball. Because the boy turned himself with also three legs. And then they got along to play outside. The dog. Happy. Happy. A little excited. Sad. Mad. Scared. Hurt. Very very very mad. Fine, regular. Happy. Happy. Happy.
