No. With the dog? The kid was playing his game in the house and then the mom came down with a box and it was dog. And then the kid realized the dog had half a leg and he was kind of like pissed at that. And then he started playing with the dog and then at the end of the movie you saw that he had the same thing with his leg. No. It was cute that they both like helped each other. That the kid kicked the dog. The mom. Dog. Playing video games. A ball. They both had half a leg. Alright. Happy. Excited. I thought it was nice. That clip really me off. Sad. Angry. Really pissed that he did that. Sad but trying to be happy. Angry. Really pissed that he kicked the dog. Mm-hmm (affirmative). Happy. Happy, still. Happy.
