And then he got, I think, then he got mad. And then he, then the dog, the dog keep coming near him, he kicked the dog. The first time he was being mean to the dog, but then he started to like be nice to the dog. And then, when he went ... Then when ... Then the dog bring the ball to him and then he started smiling and went outside. Then when the camera pointed to him, on the kid, he missing ... One of his legs was gone too, and you can see him on crutches and he was going outside with the dog with the ball. Yeah, no. Actually that like ... That he could understand him like, to like be grateful and not like just judge something by it's just cover and stuff like that. When he kicked the dog. The mom. The box, it was a puppy. He was playing his console. A ball. They were both missing a leg. Both. Happy. Happy. Happy. Rejected. Mad. Sad. Rejected again. Mad, still. Even more sad. Happy. Happy. Happy.
