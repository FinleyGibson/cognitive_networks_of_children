Where do you want me to look at? The little animated short? Yeah. Yeah. There was a boy who was like a young teenager who was playing video games at home and then his mom came home with a cardboard box. I couldn't hear that well, so I couldn't exactly hear what she said exactly, but it was along the lines of like, "Why don't you go outside for once? It's nice outside." And he was like, "Nah." And she put the box down on the table right in front of him, and he looked around it 'cause it was in his way. And then she's like, "Why don't you open up the gift I got for you?" And then he opened it up, and it was a puppy. And it was like, "Aw, that's so cool." And then he saw it was missing a foot, and he's like "Ew, gross." No. It was cute. His mother. A dog with a disabled foot. Playing video games. A red ball. I kind of explained all these things. They're missing ... Well, it's kind of the same and different because they're different sizes, but the dog's missing a foot, and the boy's missing half of his leg. I gotta watch it again? Okay. Oh, I can actually hear some Wow, that's horrible. It was so off sync. That's all I could focus on was the lag. Really happy. Really excited. Besides the fact that the lag was horrible, I was like, "Okay. Cool." Confused. Disgusted and angry. I have a neutral feeling throughout this whole thing. It was just, "Oh, that's cute." That's really it. I've also seen this before so I know what happens. He wanted attention from the boy and then he wanted to play. Still angry and upset and disgusted. Neutral. They have a giraffe decoration. That's so random. I watch animations a lot so I notice this kind of weird stuff. Excited, happy. Happy. Neutral.
