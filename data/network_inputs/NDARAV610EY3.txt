No The kid was playing video games and his mom came and brought him a present and ignored him ... and when he opened the present he saw it was a dog, but saw it was missing a leg, so he just ignored it ... and the dog was trying to play with him and as soon as the kid gave in, the dog and the kids went outside ... and the kid was also missing a leg so, they ended up, I guess, having a lot of fun. Not really. I like the way it had a kid and a dog interacting. I don't really know. The mom. A puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They're both missing a leg. Both. I think the puppy was feeling excited that he has a family now. I also think he was feeling excited and I think, like, he thought the puppy was going to be a really good addition. Pretty happy. I think he was feeling sad and that he was just left alone. Disappointed that the puppy wasn't exactly what he wanted. I felt kind of sad that the boy just dis-offed the puppy. I think he was upset that the kid didn't want to play with him. I think he just didn't like the puppy. I felt kind of mad at the kid. I think the puppy was feeling excited and, like, that the kid wanted to play with him now. I think he was excited that even though the puppy wasn't perfect, it was still really good. I felt happy.
