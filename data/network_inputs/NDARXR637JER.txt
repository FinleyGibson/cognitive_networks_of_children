No. So this boy, he is playing video games, and he's annoying everyone else. And his mom brings him a disabled dog. And he doesn't like the dog so he doesn't acknowledge it, but then he learns to like the dog after a few minutes. But he, when he gets up, he notices and he likes it. He thinks, well he's disabled. He goes outside with the dog too. It's really sweet. I liked it. Not really, no. I liked that he loved, like he loved the dog. And he wasn't so mean to it afterwards. It was a really sweet movie. I really liked it. The animation style wasn't great. I don't really like the dog's eyes that much. They were kind of weird. His mom. The dog. Playing video games. I don't remember, had ball. They're the same because, well, they're both disabled, but doesn't really put a toll on them. But I liked how they're the same because of their friendship. Really sweet. The puppy was feeling really happy. I think he was feeling happy at first, but when he discovered that the dog didn't have a leg, he was unhappy. Warm and bubbly. Sad, but didn't really take a toll on his actual feelings. Upset, because his dog was disabled. It was really sad. Still happy, but a little sad. Upsetish, kind of. Not really happy. Happy. Happy. Happy.
