No. Well this boy, he didn't really like the dog, 'cause it lost a leg. And it wants to play with him, but he didn't care about the puppy. But then more in the movie he liked the dog. And then he played fetch with the dog. And then they become friends. And the boy lost one of his leg. No. The puppy playing. Him like being mean to the puppy. His mother. A puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They both lost one of their legs. Yes. Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad. Mean. Not really ... I was feeling sad. A little bit sad. Mean. Mad at the boy. Happy. Happy. Very happy.
