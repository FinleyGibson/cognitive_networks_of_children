Yeah, I seen it before. There was a boy playing video games, the mom got him a present, it was 3 legged dog. And, the boy didn't wanna play with him. And then he just decided to play with him because he was begging. And they were playing in the backyard. The dog was running into things? No. That the dog was bumping into things, and he was like falling over. That's it. All the other things I didn't say. No. The mom. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. They both lost one leg. Both. Okay. Happy. Happy? Boring. Yeah. Sad. Angry. Like, hysterical. It was hysterical. When he dropped the puppy like . Sad? Happy? Maybe happy tears? Happy sad. Had. Angry. Because he didn't want the dog to bother him while he was playing the video games that weren't important. Happy because that was hysterical. Hysterical like get lost. Happy. Happy. Same thing. Yeah.
