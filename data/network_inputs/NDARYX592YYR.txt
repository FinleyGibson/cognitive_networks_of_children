No. I'm trying to. The boy was playing a video game and a package came in. And there was a puppy inside it. First, he didn't wanna play with the puppy but then he did. That the puppy came in the box. Well, I liked it had a puppy. I didn't really like that he didn't wanna play with the puppy. His mom. A puppy. He was playing a video game. A ball. They're both playful? Both. I mean, the boy. Okay. I think it was feeling excited. Excited? Like so curious. I don't know. Like, I don't know. A little yucky. A little lonely. I don't know. A little, I don't know. I see you using the thing. Why's he missing a leg? Playful? Playful. Playful.
