He got a cactus. And then the dog open it for them. And then he got the uppen. And then he throw up, and then it was done. Uh-huh (negative). The dog. The boy did not have one leg cut off. The mom. A dog. Me saw one leg cut off. A ball. Not the same. Angry. Angry. That's- Good. . Angry. Angry. I don't know. Happy. Good. Good. Fun.
