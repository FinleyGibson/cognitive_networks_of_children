No. A kid was playing some kind of shoot 'em up video game, and his mother came home and put a box in front of him. And he wasn't really listening. He was like, you know, just playing on his video game, and then his mom said, "Why don't you open the present I got you?" And then she ran upstairs and he was so weirded out, he opened the box and he saw that there was a dog and he said, "Oh cool!" And the dog jumps out of the box towards him, and then he picks him up and is just like looking at him for a few seconds, and then sees that he has a nub instead of a leg and he throws him to the side.                     And then the dog tried to go back to him, and he just pushed him away. And then when the dog got pushed away, he saw a ball. So he ran for the ball and he stumbled a few times to go and get it, and then he brought it back to the boy and the boy just kicked it and it went into the box. And the dog ran towards the box and the box fell on top of him and he was just running into things. And then he got the box off of him and then ... what was that part? 
 That was it. I liked the dog. The dog was really cute. That's basically it. The just plain cruelty towards the animal just was not nice. His mother. A dog. Playing video games. Uh, fetch. Oh. A ball. They both have a leg missing. Happy. Excited to see him. I don't know. He cared for it. I thought, "Oh, that's cool. I like that." I was like, "That would be me," and then ... yeah. Well rejected and really sad. Upset. Disappointed. So sad! Rejected and unloved. Annoyed. Sad again. Relieved and really excited was probably the dog. And the boy probably felt happy to play with the dog. Better about the situation but doesn't excuse ... I was happy for the dog but still a little annoyed with the boy.
