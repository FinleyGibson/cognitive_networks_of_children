Yeah. Well, it started out with this boy playing video games at the TV and he's really focused and didn't want to be annoyed by anybody else. And then his mom gives him a box and he's just really not interested and then he opens the box and then he sees a puppy but he notices the puppy is missing a limb. So he kind of just throws it to the side and doesn't care about it. And then the puppy wants attention but he doesn't care and he kicks it and stuff. But then the puppy wants to play a game and he kind of just throws the ball away from the puppy. And then the puppy's just doing the thing like trying to play the game by himself and then he sees that he can still without having that extra leg that he's still able to have fun and play. And so he decides to go play with him outside. That's when they reveal that he's also missing a leg. The puppy was kind of growing really close with him, wanting to play. Well, I liked the dog and I guess seeing the kid kind of realize ... I don't know how to explain it but I guess he was kind of dealing with a little bit of self hatred too until the puppy could help bring him out of that. Well, I didn't like to see the puppy being kicked. He's so cute. His mother. The puppy. He was playing games. The ball. They both are kids, both missing a limb. Okay. Really excited, kind of didn't know what to do. Also excited. I forgot that the puppy was really adorable. Kind of shocked and really . Angry. Disappointed. Neglected and wanted attention. Just annoyed and dismissive. Still bad, disappointed. Again, excited and really just doesn't know what to do with all of this excitement. Enlightened. Happy.
