No. In the movie, this boy was playing a video game, and he got a surprise from him mom. It was a puppy. But before he didn't like it, but now he liked it and then played with it. The boy played ball with the puppy. That ... The lesson. The lesson is what I mostly liked about the movie. It was if you have a disability, you could still do stuff. That was my favorite thing. The boy would sit down and play video games all day. The mom. A puppy. Playing a video game. A ball. They're the same because both of them were busy doing something. The boy was busy with the video game, and the puppy was busy playing with the ball. Okay. I love this. Happy that he got an owner. Excited that he got the puppy at first. I felt overjoyed because that was so cute. Well, after that throw, I think he felt a little broken-hearted. Disgusted because the puppy licked him, and he was like, "Ew!". I felt almost broken-hearted because that was a cute little puppy. Again, broken-hearted because the boy just him. "C'mon, you see I'm busy." Again, broken-hearted. See? The dog's like Doug from Up. Doug from Up, except as puppy form with the big nose, the color, everything. Overjoyed and full-hearted. Excited that he was not staying in the house playing a video game and doing nothing. Hearted. That's how I would Hearted, because that's how I would be to a puppy.
