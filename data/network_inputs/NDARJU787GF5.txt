His mom gave him a dog, he didn't want a dog. He wanted to play ball, but he just sitting playing his video game. Then he kicked the ball and then the dog run and then he got the ball. Then he got to the person, the person ... he went outside. I liked nothing about the movie. No. His mom. A dog. He was playing games. A ball. They foot is cut off. Both. Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad. Sad. Happy. Because I like to watch the movie . Happy. Mad. Because his foot was cut off. Happy. That's the end of the movie? Happy, very happy. Happy, just happy. Happy. Cause I'm watching a movie.
