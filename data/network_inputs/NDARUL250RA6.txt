Bad. No way. Well, there was a boy who was playing on the TV, he was injured. There was a doggie who only had three legs, and then they went outside to play with each other. The doggie wanted to play. Wait, are you videoing me? Are you videoing me? Oh. Blah, blah, blah. Nope. I just wanted to see a movie. Nevermind. I can't answer that question. I can't answer that question. Because I don't know that question. Nobody ever asked me that question. Well, some people. What? I'm not thinking of it. I'm thinking of Pokemon cards. What? His mom. The puppy with the three legs. He was playing a video game on the TV. A ball. Because they both have no legs. Okay. Okay. Watch another one? Happy. Happy. Nothing. Happy still. Not happy; sad. I have no idea. Still happy. He was mad. I have no idea. You missed a part. Both of them were happy again. Still happy. Still happy. Happy.
