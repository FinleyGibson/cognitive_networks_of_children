No I hadn't. So, um, a kid was playing video games and his mom came home with a box. He was annoyed because she put the box down in front of him. Then she told him to stop playing the game and to open up the box to see what she had gotten for him. He opened up the box and saw a puppy inside and when he picked it up he saw that it was missing one leg. So, when he put it down, he actually threw it down because he was annoyed with it. Um, and then when it wanted his attention he kicked it to the side. Um, then he threw a ball for it and he got, um, he smiled as it, um, as it tripped like over the ball and ran back to him. Um, and eventually after ... After doing that for a little bit he, um, stopped playing with the video game. Um, stood up and he grabbed his ... Arm supports, I think? Things that helped him walk, because he had one of his legs amputated from the knee down. So then he went outside to play with the dog. Um, no ... Yeah, no. Well that he realized that he shouldn't have been hurting the dog and he stopped. That he hurt the dog. His mom. A puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They both were missing leg. Both. Okay. Happy. Happy, I guess. I didn't really hear what he was saying because it was loud in there. Happy. Hurt. Annoyed. Bad, because he threw a puppy. Hurt, again. Annoyed, again. Bad. Okay. They were both happy. Yeah. Happy as well.
