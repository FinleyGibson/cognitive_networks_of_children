No. This kid was playing a video game, and his mom brought him a puppy with only three legs, and he only had one leg. And then he went outside and played with the puppy with three legs. He pushed the dog over to the side. He started to like the dog. That he pushed the dog over to the side. His mom. The dog. Playing video games. A red ball. They had both their legs cut off. Both. Okay. Happy. Happy. Good. Sad and confused. Angry. I guess a little bit mad. Still confused. Mad because the dog had only three legs. A little bit mad. Mm-hmm (affirmative). Happy. Happy too. Good.
