No. Okay, so at the beginning the boy was playing video games and he wasn't really paying attention to anything else. His mom came in and gave him a box and when he finally opened the box, there was a puppy inside. At first, he was really happy, but then he saw that the puppy's leg was like, not there, and he got upset and didn't want the puppy anymore. He kicked a ball and then the puppy ran after it and tried to get it. It was a little bit difficult for him, but he came back with the ball. And the boy started to warm up to the puppy and he started to be happy about the puppy again. And then he decided to go out and play with the puppy and you saw that the boy also didn't have his leg and both of them were going outside to play together. Not that I think is particularly important. I thought it was really sweet, 'cause at first I was like, "Oh, that's so sad, he doesn't want the puppy." But then when I saw that they both had something in common and they both seemed really happy in the end, I thought that was really sweet. I'm not sure, like at the beginning I was like, "This is sad." But, by the end, not really. I assume it was his mom. Puppy. Video games. Red ball. They both have a leg missing. Happy. Happy. Happy. I don't know, off guard I guess. He didn't really look upset or anything. Upset. Upset. Upset, let down. Angry. Angry. Happy. Happy. Happy.
