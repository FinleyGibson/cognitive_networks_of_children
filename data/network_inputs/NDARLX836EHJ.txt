Uh-uh (negative). The mommy brought the boy a present while he was still watching TV. He opened it up and it was a dog. Then the dog went out and then he didn't like the dog and then he didn't want to play. Then they went out to play because he liked him. No. That the guy had the broken leg. That he didn't like the dog. The mom. A dog. Playing. The ball. Because they were both playing. Mm-hmm (affirmative). Happy. Happy. I don't know. Sad. Angry. I don't know. Sad. Angry. I don't know. He has a broken leg. Why does he have a broken leg? How do you get a broken leg? Happy. Happy. I don't know.
