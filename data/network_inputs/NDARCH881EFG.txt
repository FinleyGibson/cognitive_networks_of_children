No. I don't know. Maybe. Yeah, so the kid was playing video games and his mom brought home a box. She opened up all the shades. I couldn't really hear it that well, but he wasn't really happy about it. Then the dog kept on running around and stuff, and he realized that the dog didn't have a leg like him. The dog got stuck a lot and fell over, and he nudged the ball back over to him, and they went outside and played with it. No. I like dogs. I was sad that he didn't have a leg, but ... That the dog didn't have a leg. The guy also didn't have a leg. There's nothing really else that happened that much. The mom. The dog. Playing video games. A ball. They both don't have a leg. Well, they're both missing one. All right. Happy to finally get out of the box and excited to have a new owner. He kind of said it. He thinks the dog is cool. I guess he's excited. I don't know. Happy. Why'd he say, "Uh?" Sad, because the kid is disgusted with the puppy because he doesn't have a leg. Disgusted. Bad for the dog. Sad and disappointed. Angry. Angry because that guy seems mean. This has to be some sort of Disney movie. Both of them were happy. The same.
