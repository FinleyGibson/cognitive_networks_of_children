The puppy dog? The kid was playing video games, so his mom bought him a dog. Then he was kicking the dog, then the dog got the ball and wanted to play. And the end, the kid went outside. Yes. They played outside. Outside the dog found the ball ... before they went outside. I don't know. The sounds. The mom. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. They were both living things. Both. How are they missing a leg? Why are they missing- Happy. Happy. Happy. He missed a leg. Upset. Upset. No, weirded out. Happy. Not really. Good. So ... I wonder if the boy- Upset still. Sad. Upset. Sad or upset. Okay. He's missing a leg. His leg got chopped off? Happy. Happy. Happy.
