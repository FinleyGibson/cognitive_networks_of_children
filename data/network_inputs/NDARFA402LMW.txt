No. Okay, so there was a kid that was playing video games and his brother gave him this box and he decided to open it, and there was a puppy that had like one leg that was weird. And then he put the puppy on the floor and continued playing his video games. The puppy would come over and he just pushed it away. Then the puppy saw a ball and he would bring it to him. Then finally he went outside where he took these like crutches. He was also like missing a leg, so he took his crutches and he went outside. Then he started playing fetch and stuff. That's basically what I remember. I don't really not like it or did like it. His mother. The puppy. He was playing video games. A red ball. They both had like one leg missing. Both. What's the movie called? Excited. First he was like, "Cool." I don't know. Probably felt a little bad and lonely. Like, "I don't want this puppy." I just felt bad for the puppy. He wanted to play with him. Like he wanted the dog to just go away. I don't know. Happy to play with someone. Like happy to have puppy. I don't know, .
