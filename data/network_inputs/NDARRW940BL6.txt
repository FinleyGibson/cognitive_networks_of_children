No. This boy, he kept on playing his video games. Then when his mom came in, he stopped playing his video game and then he opened up the box. He found the dog, but he realized that the dog had lost one leg and he didn't exactly like that. Then the dog, he wanted to try to play with the kid. Then later on, the kid stopped playing the video game and went outside to play with the dog. I noticed that the kid was just like the dog. The way that the dog convinced the boy to go play with him, it was by using the ball to try to make the kid notice him more. That the dog and the boy had a relationship, like they were connected. I think that's why the reason the mom bought that kind of dog. That I didn't like that the dog kept on falling because he did have the extra leg. The mom. The dog. He was playing his video game. The ball. Because they both lost one leg. Yes. He was feeling really happy. Very happy too. I felt really happy too. Really sad. Really mad. Sad. I think he was feeling a little bit happy, but still sad. Angry. Still sad. Very happy. Happy. Happy.
