No. So basically, it's a really nice day out and there's a kid. He's playing video games. And then, his mom comes home with a box and she puts it down in front of him. He's like, "No, you're blocking my view." And he's real- No, first she asks how his day is. And, he doesn't respond, cuz he's too distracted by the video games. And then she puts the box in front of him. He's like, "Hey mom, get out of the way." And then, he tri- He moves over and looks like he's really like involved in his video game. And then he's like, his mom's like, "Oh it's such a nice day out. You should play outside." And he's like, "Whatever." And then, he's like really involved in his video game. And then, he decides to look in the box and it's a dog.                     And then, I don't really know what happened but I think he picks it up and he notices something. He's like, "Oh it's not good." Then he throws it down and then he starts playing video games and doesn't pay attention to the dog. And then, the dog notices a ball and starts like playing with that. And pokes the ball against him so that he could, they could play fetch. But he's like, "No." He kicks it away. He's like, "No I'm playing video games. Whatever." And it seems like he should play with his dog, not be on the video games. And then, the dog just starts playing around with it. And then, he keeps noticing the dog and looking at it. He's like, "Oh maybe I should play with the dog." And then, he starts more and more thinking that he should. And then, he finally gets up and you see that he has like ... Half, of one of his legs, half of it isn't there and he needs crutches.
 No. That, it's so like realistic. I don't know. The mom. A dog or a puppy. He was playing video games. A ball. A red ball. That the puppy is focused playing with ... is distracted on the thing that it's doing and same with the boy. So, maybe they weren't paying attention to each other and just paying, like focused on what they were doing. And then, At the end, they realized that, I guess it would be better if they played with each other. So. Oh, maybe what he saw was that the dog didn't have, one it's legs wasn't there. Both of them. Okay. I think it was feeling really happy and so was the boy. They were both like, oh cool. Yeah. Seeing where it would lead, because it seemed like the boy was too focused on his video games but then now he has a dog. A puppy or whatever. So, I wanted to see if he keeps going back to the video games or starts playing with the dog. Like, it felt like bad that just because it didn't have one of its' paws that the boy thought it was trash. Upset that it wasn't a normal dog. Seemed like oh, he's probably gonna go back on his video games now. Like, same thing. I think not wanted and- Annoyed. Feeling bad for the puppy. Alright. Wanted and happy. He reali- I think he was realizing that it doesn't matter and it was still like a regular puppy. And I think he was also happy. Happy.
