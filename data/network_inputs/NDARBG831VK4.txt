No. Well, the kid was playing video games, the mom came home with the present. His mom went upstairs for a phone call, and then he opened the box, and then he played with the dog, but then he didn't really like it, but then he decided to play with him outside, and play catch, but he had crutches. So, yeah. No. That there was a puppy that was playing, and I like puppies. That the boy was mean to the dog. The mom. A dog. He was playing video games, on the couch. A red ball. The boy can't walk good, and the dog can't run that good, either. The boy. Okay. Really happy, and now that he has a family, he's really excited. He's feeling happy and sad, because it was a dog and he got one. I felt surprised because they never said if it was someone's birthday, or Christmas. Mad because he didn't have a hand. Annoyed because the mom felt they had something in common, because he didn't have a leg and the puppy didn't have a hand. I felt kind of annoyed, just because he didn't have a hand doesn't mean you can't like him and have fun with him. Mad, because he kicked him. Annoyed. Annoyed, because you shouldn't do that to a dog. Happy that he finally threw the ball outside. Happy because he finally got off the couch, and now he gets to play with his new dog. I felt happy because he finally decided and knew that he should do something nice to the dog, because his mom gave him the dog.
