I saw the short clip before. I saw it before. So what happened is the mom, her son had a missing leg. So she had an idea and she got him a puppy that also had a missing leg. So she thought that maybe they would bond, but in the beginning the boy didn't like the puppy because he had a missing leg. And then he got mad and he started kicking the puppy and pushing the puppy, and he wouldn't pay attention to it.                     And then at the end what happened was, all the sudden, then he noticed how him and the dog are similar because of their disability. And then they started to become friends, and they went outside and they played fetch with the red ball.
 I remember that in the beginning he wouldn't go outside and he didn't help his mother pack or unpack. And he was addicted to his video games, and when the mother opened the curtain, he was acting like he was blind and he couldn't see. What I liked about the movie was because ... I would say that you can ... It takes a while ... I would say that it has multiple themes in it. And that, I also like it because it's showing how you can have a connection with a dog. Even if you have a disability, you can always find the right dog. What I didn't like is in the beginning when the mom got the dog, and the boy just kept on pushing him and kicking him, and when the dog was falling, the boy didn't help him up. His mother. A puppy with a missing leg. He was playing his video game in the dark. A red ball. They both have a disability, missing a leg. Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think he was feeling happy and not abandoned because, probably his other owner abandoned him because of his missing leg. I think he was feeling happy at first. I felt happy. And I felt like nothing bad was gonna happen. Confused. Mad. Angry and upset. Angry, confused, and sad. Angry, mad, and confused to what happened to his leg. Angry and sad. Happy and ... Happy. Happy and excited. I was feeling happy, joyful, and not angry anymore.
