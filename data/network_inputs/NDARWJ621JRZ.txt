No. Okay. A boy was playing video games, and then his mom came with a box. He kept on playing video games for a long time, and then he finally opened the box while the mom was on her phone walking upstairs. Then there was a dog with three legs, he didn't have one leg. He was walking around and the boy kept on kicking the dog, putting the dog away. Then he through the ball at the dog and he thought the dog was kind of funny so he went outside with the dog, and he had one leg too. Then he threw the ball and the dog was playing. Not really. That the boy and the dog were the same kind of thing. They both had a leg off. Nothing. The mom. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. They have one leg off. Both. Happy. Excited. Good. Mad. Mad. Not so good. Sad. Annoyed. It was bad. Happy. Happy. Good because they got along.
