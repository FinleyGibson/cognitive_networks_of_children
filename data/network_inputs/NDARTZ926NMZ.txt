Oh, The Present? No. But I just watched that other movie, Minions. That movie ... Well ... Well, I saw that guy playing on his TV. I only just remembered that that guy was playing on the TV. That's all I just remembered. There was a dog that he opened and that was his present. Well, some things are like ... I liked how that guy ... I liked the ending, how that guy was playing fetch with the dog. Well, I didn't ... Wait, there's another part in the first ending when he was playing on the TV. I like playing fetch and I like playing on the TV. I didn't like how the dog was messing around while he was playing his game. The mom. The dog. You mean, like ... I don't know what you mean before he ... I don't know what you are saying before. When the movie was starting, he played the game first. The puppy ... The puppy was playing with the ball. Well, I don't know how they are the same. No. Can I watch some of ? Can I watch that one? He was feeling good. The boy was ... The boy was feeling good when that dog was his present. Good. Why did he do that? I don't know why he did ... When he threw him off? Maybe he was nervous. Bad. I think because he smells bad. Or maybe that's why ... Or maybe he doesn't like it. He doesn't like ... Nervous. Maybe sad. He was still mad. Sad. That was sad. How did I like the end. I already know how the end was feeling. I already know. I know how both of them ... Good. Good. Good.
