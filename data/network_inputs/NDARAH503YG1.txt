No. Well, I didn't get to see the full movie. Oh. So, there was a kid who opened the box and the dog jumped out and then when he saw his paw he was like "Ew", and then he threw him. And then he was upset . But the last part I remember which was like he came outside, I forget also he lost a leg too. That's all I can remember. Nope. Actually, I don't know. Hmm, nothing. His mom. A dog, which I just explained a few minutes ago. Playing video games. A ball. They both lost a leg. Well, he lost an arm, he lost a leg, and the dog lost an arm. Okay. Happy. Happy. Normal. Sad. Mad. Normal. Upset. Mad. Normal. Okay. Really happy. Happy. Normal.
