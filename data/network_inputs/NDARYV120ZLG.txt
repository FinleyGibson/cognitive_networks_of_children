No. There's a boy who's playing video games, and then his mother comes home late, and she has a present for him. And when he says ... And then he opens the present, and then he looks at the puppy, but when he looks at him, he only has one arm and two legs. And he doesn't have one arm. So he doesn't like the puppy, so he doesn't really do nothing with it. He doesn't play with it. But then the puppy just never gives up, and he keeps trying to get his attention. And then finally he grabs his attention, and it turns out that he actually has no leg, and they play outside. Uh-uh. I like how the dog never gave up, and I like how it kept trying. I didn't like when the boy was not paying attention to the dog. His mother. A puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They both have only ... They both have ... a body part that they don't have. Like a body part that they somehow just ... something happened to it. Alright. Happy? Excited. Joyful. Alone. Sad. Upset and angry. Unhappy. Upset? Anger. Sad. Happy. Happy too. Happy.
