No. So, there was a boy, who was, like, obsessed with his video games. Then his mom came home one day, and she put a box on the table. He opened it, and there was a dog in it. He saw that the dog was missing a leg. The dog started doing funny things. He finally decided to throw the ball to the dog. Then he went out ... Then he stood up, and he went to the door to go outside with the dog. That's when I realized that the boy also had ... realized that he was so upset that the dog had one too. No. I like the ending. It was good to see that he liked the dog. Usually people won't like something cause it's not perfect, so. I'd like it to be longer so I just know what happened after. The boy's mother. A dog. He was playing video games. A ball. They're both missing, like, a leg, or him ... It was excited. He was also excited. I don't know. It was like ... It was kinda surprising that it popped out. And I was like ... I don't know. Like a little bit upset that he was pushed on the floor. He was mad that he saw that the dog had the same thing as him. A little bit sad that they both had a disability. A little bit determined. He was trying to make the boy like him and have fun, even though he was being pushed. He was mad that ... He was still mad about the dog. I felt bad for the dog that he was being kicked around. Happy that the boy had the same thing as him, so he finally had someone else. Happy that he also had someone else, or something else that had the same thing. Happy that they both got along finally.
