No. Which one? Well the boy was playing a video game and the dog kept on bothering him. No, I didn't watch all of it. They went outside to play. Nothing. That the dog was bothering the boy. Who gave the box? His mom. A puppy. Playing a video game. His ball. Because they like playing games. What? Let's watch a short clip from the movie and then we'll take about it. Talk about it. It froze. Happy. Excited. Like the boy. I felt like the boy. Sad. Mad. Sad. Because the boy pushed the puppy. Very mad that he ... because he wanted to turn over and walk and he wanted the boy to play with him. Angry. Because the puppy kept on bothering him. Because he was very ... because he was bothering him a lot. A little like I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, I felt like everything. Happy. Because the boy and him were playing together. Happy too. Because the puppy ... because he felt like he actually wanted to stop his video game and go with the puppy outside. I felt happy. Because they were playing together.
