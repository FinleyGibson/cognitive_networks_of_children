Yeah. The kid was sitting on his couch playing video games and then his mom gave him a dog, but the dog was missing a leg so at first he didn't like it. And then he noticed that it was acting like every other dog. So, he started to like it. And then he went outside to play with it. When he stood up, he was missing a leg too. So yeah. I guess it was ... it wasn't a city because the house seemed like pretty big and he definitely had a backyard so it didn't really seem like it was in a city. I guess ... I don't know. I liked it, I just don't know exactly what I liked about it. I just liked it. I guess like the animations were cool, I guess. I don't really not like anything about it. It was pretty cool. His mom. A dog. Playing video games. A red ball. They were both missing a leg. Both. Happy. Happy. I guess interested because like it was the very beginning so I didn't know what was going to happen. I guess happy and like sad because like he got thrown on the floor. Mad. I was still interested because I still didn't really know how it was going to like end up. He was kind of like excited but like yeah because it still seemed pretty happy. Still mad. Mad at the boy because he just kicked the dog. Happy. Happy. Happy.
