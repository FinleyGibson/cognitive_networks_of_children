No. The kid was playing this game then his mom came home. And the kid just opened the box and there was a puppy. And the kid just kicked the puppy. No. The dog. The kid, just playing with the dog. I just want to speak in that. The kid just kicked the puppy.                     Is this one talking this?
 The mom. The dog. He opened it. He just open it, then it was a puppy, then he kicked the dog. He kicked the dog. He was playing with the dog. The ball. Because the boy's, kid's leg came off. And the puppy doesn't have no legs off. I want it, I want it over here. Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad. Mad. Sad. Mad. Mad. Sad. Happy. Happy. Happy.
