No. Just for, no I didn't. In the beginning, the boys mom brought him a dog, and in the middle, the dog wanted to play with him, but he didn't have time to play with him. And the in the end, he played with him. He opened the box, and it was a puppy. That the puppy arrived, it was so cute. That the puppy wanted to play with him and it took it a while to finish the story. His mom. The puppy. He was playing video games. Everything. He likes to do. They always like each other. Mm-hmm (affirmative). They have the same skin. Happy. Surprised. Kind of, happy. Sad. Angry. So-so angry. Sometimes, I feel angry as somebody does that to their dog. Or puppy Because he was so stinky. Happy, because he thinks that the boy liked him. So, angry because he's disturbing him. So-so bored. Then he took him out. Then, they played outside. Then they played outside. Happy. Happy. Happy.
