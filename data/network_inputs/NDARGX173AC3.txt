Yes. The boy was playing video games and his mother brought in a box saying that he should open it. It took him a while to finally open it. When he opened it there was a dog. He picked it up until he realized it had one arm missing, then he kind of just threw it on the floor. The dog tried getting his attention by getting a red ball and asking to play. The boy kind of just shrugged it off. Then for like a few minutes he was like, "Okay." And then like you realized the boy also was missing like a leg. He tells his mom he's going outside to play ball with the dog. I don't know. It was interesting. Was that I've seen it before. The mother. A dog. Playing video games. The red ball. They're both missing a leg or an arm. The puppy. I mean the boy. How do you think the puppy was feeling? How do you think the boy was feeling? How did you feel when you watched this part?
