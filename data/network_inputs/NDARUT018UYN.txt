No. Okay. So, the boy was just playing the video game. And then the mom walked in and brought him a box. And she left it on the table, but he didn't want to open it, so then he kept playing his video game. And then he stopped his video game, and he opened the box, and it was a dog. And he picked it up. He was all happy. And then he saw that the leg, like, he didn't have one leg. So then he like put him down, and pushed him. And then he started playing his video game again.                     Then the dog saw like a red ball, and he went over to the ball, and took it, and brought it over to the kid. And then he placed it down, the dog, and the boy just kept playing his video game and ignored the dog. And the dog dropped the ball in the box, and he went to go get it, and he was like fooling around in the box and he was laughing a little bit. Then he got back into his game. Then the dog came back with the red ball. He left it there. And then he actually got the ball and stood up, and then I saw that he didn't have a leg, the boy. So then he went outside, and he was playing with the dog with the ball. 
 No. The dog was cute. Yeah. I have. The mom. The dog. Playing video game. The red ball. They both don't have one part of their body. Excited and like, happy. Excited and happy. Happy for him. Sad. Angry. Like a little mad, sort of. Kind of like, happy and sad at the same time. Angry. I don't know. Like, surprised. Happy. Happy. Happy.
