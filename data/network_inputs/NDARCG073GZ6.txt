Mm-mm (negative). Wait, which movie? The first one or the second? Okay. The kid was playing on his Xbox. Then, his mom came home with a present. There was a doggy in the box. He was like, "I don't want a dog." Then, the dog kept playing around. Then, he looked at the dog. Then, him and the dog started playing together. Then, that was the end. How cute the doggy was and how that kid is like me playing on the Xbox. That the kid didn't like the dog at first, because I love dogs whenever I see them, except if they're trying to bite me. His mom. A doggy. Playing his Xbox, like I do. A red ball. They like playing with each other at the end. The boy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Confused, and sad, and angry. No, not angry, just confused and sad. Disgusted that the puppy was licking him. Okay. Weird. At first confused about, then I saw the puppy with . tied to a Xbox controller. Happy and then like, "What just happened?" Still disgusted. Weird. Whoa, they have a giraffe there. Happy. Happy that he made a new friend. Happy.
