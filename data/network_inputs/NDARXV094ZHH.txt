No. What happened was it was this kid who was a teenager, and his mom ... He was playing video games, and then his mom disturbed him. His mom basically disturbed him and put a box in front of him. A box. Then the boy at first was uninterested, and his mom opened the blinds and told him to go outside with this thing. He opened the box and he found out it was a dog. At first, he was excited. But then while he was playing his video games, then he finally opened it and he noticed it was a dog, right? And he thinks it was very cool, right?                     Then he was very uninterested in it because the dog basically only had three legs. Not four, because his leg was amputated. Because the dog received the amputation I think earlier before the story happened. The boy was very uninterested and kept the dog, and he was a little disturbed and mad. He put the dog back in the box and started playing his video games. But then his dog kept playing. He got out and went to the ball. Wait, hold up. He didn't put it in the box. He didn't put it in the box. He just put it away.
 It shows compassion. It shows kindness. It shows looks can be deceiving. Looks can be very deceiving. And just play with it a little bit. Don't judge how it is. If it just has three legs, don't assume it's bad. Don't assume it's a bad thing. Don't try to assume, as looks can be very deceiving. What I did not like about the movie is that the boy treated the dog horribly and kept playing his video games. Even though I'm a great video game player, I love playing video games a lot, I love doing a lot of gaming, I still find it disrespectful to life. It's very mean. It's very rude. It's not that nice. It is not kind at all. It kind of made me like, "What kind of boy is this? You don't understand the humanity." Go ahead. His mom. The dog who received the amputation. He was typically playing his video games. The big red ball. They both have their legs amputated. They both don't have legs. They're amputated. Both. The puppy was feeling happy and joyful and relieved that he got out of the box, because he wants to play with the boy. It seemed that the boy wants to play with him. The boy felt very excited. He felt excited and stopped playing his video games. I feel like it's a typical moment when you get a new dog. I feel like ... Because when an enthusiastic kid is really excited to get a new dog, a new pet, that's pretty typical. The puppy was feeling happy at first, but then the puppy was thrown and then he felt sad that he felt ... The puppy felt useless. The puppy felt very useless and pretty sad. Upset and stressed. Next. It felt very rude because you're not supposed ... If I was that boy, I would put the dog down, but it's very mean, because throwing a dog on the floor. It's not very ... You could have seriously injured the dog. You could literally injure it. It's very bad. The puppy was still feeling happy. He still wants to play with him, even though the boy keeps harassing the dog. He keeps harassing the dog a lot. He felt happy. He felt he wants to play with him. You feel like he's still ... Because what was the word again? Because ... Well, never mind, I can't remember the word, but go ahead. The boy was feeling upset, because the dog keeps following him. The dog keeps bothering him. Next. I feel like the dog should just go back upstairs, run away, and go hide in a corner or something. I felt disturbed, because he's still not treating the dog like it's a normal living being. Go ahead. The puppy was feeling ... He keeps encouraging him, the boy, to play the ball with him. He keeps encouraging him. He's trying so hard, because what he has is perseverance. He has perseverance. And the puppy was still feeling glad and happy. Go ahead. The boy finally felt happy and relieved, and wanted to play with the dog more. I felt kind of good, because it is good to understand that the boy is ... After the boy abused the dog by throwing him and neglecting him, now he finally understood. Go next.
