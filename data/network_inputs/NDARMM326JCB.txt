No. The boy was playing video games, and then his mom came home with a package. She put it down and so the boy opened it, and it was a dog with three legs instead of four. So, he put the dog down and just went back to playing, then the dog brought him a ball and he kicked it away. And then the dog, he watched the dog struggle to try to get in and then he thought it was fun, so then he got his crutches and went outside, and he only had one leg. So, that's it, and they started playing catch. Not really. That the boy and the dog were similar. It was kind of shocking at the end that the boy had one leg instead of two. That the boy first neglected the dog, and that's it. His mother. The dog. Playing video games. The ball. They are each missing one leg. Excited and happy. Happy. Kind of happy. At first ... oh wait, I was happy. Sad. Mad. I felt sorry for the dog. Still sad. I think the boy was still sad, too. Still sorry for the puppy. Very happy. Happy, too. Happier.
