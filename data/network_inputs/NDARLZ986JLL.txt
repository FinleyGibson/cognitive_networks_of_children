Which one? I thought that one that I just saw. No. The mom got the boy the surprise and he opened, and he threw the puppy on the floor. Then they realized they were the same. Then they went outside to play with each other. The puppy was running around. He got trapped in a box too. They made friends at the end. The boy threw the puppy on the floor. His mom. The puppy. Playing video games. The ball. They had no leg each. Both. Okay. Happy. Happy. Cool. I mean not good. Not good. Sad. Mad. Sad. Happy still. Mad. Sad. Oh this part. I like this part. It's good. Very happy. Happy. Happy. Happy.
