No. It started out, like, this boy, and he looked like he was kinda like, really, addicted to playing video games. And then his mom came home with a dog, well, a present, and he opened it, and it was a dog. And he wasn't being very nice to the dog. And the dog tried to play with him, and he just kept kicking him away. And then, he noticed something about the dog, that he didn't have a full limb. And then, he looked at it, and he kinda got happy with it. And then, he picked up the  outside. And then he walked, and then noticed that he also didn't have a full leg, too. No. I like that he eventually loved the dog. That he was being mean to the dog. His mom. A dog. Playing video games all the time. Huh? A ball. They both don't have a full limb. Okay. Happy that he has an owner. Oh, a dog. To me, it kinda looked like he was feeling happy, but not that happy. It made me feel happy for the dog, that he has a home. That made me feel kind of upset that he just threw the dog. Not that happy. Frustrated. Kind of upset. Still, not that great, because he kept kicking him aside. Again, kinda mad that the dog just kept bothering him. Kind of upset that someone would treat a dog that way. That one made me feel happy, because the dog and the boy were playing, and it's like he stopped playing video games to go hang out with the dog, and they both were playing with the ball. Happy. Happy. Very happy.
