Yes, I have. So it starts off with the boy playing video games. And his mom comes home with a mysterious package that nobody knows about yet. So she says, "Oh, I got a gift for you." So she looks and he opened up the box and there's a puppy in it. But the puppy's missing, has a stub for this arm. So he knocks the box over and throws the puppy to the floor, saying it's worthless. In the end, yeah, in the end, we find out that he has a stub for his leg. That it shows true friendship. That the kid did the puppy to the ground. The mom. The puppy. Playing video games. The ball. They both had a stub for an arm or they both had a disorder. Both. Excited. Excited when he first saw the puppy. I saw it already, so when I first watched it or when I watched it in there? Happy. Left alone. Angry. Sad. It was still a little sad. Still angry. I felt sadness and anger. Embraced. Happy. Sad. I felt sad in a good way. I felt like, "Oh my god."
