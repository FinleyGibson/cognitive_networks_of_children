No. I haven't. Yeah. What movie? The boy lost a leg. Oh, I know. He have a dog who lost an arm. What I liked about the movie is when the boy starts to like the dog. What I don't like about the movie is how the boy lost a leg. His mom. A puppy. He was playing video games. He was playing with the ball. Because they want to be friends. Yeah. Happy. Nervous. I felt cool. Sad. Angry. Hurtful. Upset. Angry. Hurtful. Do you have the camera recording? Happy. A little happy. Happy.
