-this. No. Oh I have seen it. I'll make it short. Boy with one leg opens present. Doesn't like present. Throws it on floor. Present goes get ball because it's actually a dog. And continues throwing ball to keep it distracted until he finally gets it catched. Uh, he was just playing video games the whole time. Ah. It all so . Eh. That they just made  except since it's copyrighted, they changed the name. Eh. Just the-                     He's being so mean to the dog. It's almost like animal abuse. 
 The boys' mom. Dog. Playing video games. Ball. They both have one leg. Great. Great. Great. A bit bad, but then turns great again. Oh. Like, a bit bad. So mad. Rage. Except like misspelled rage. I don't know. Well, it started from good to bad. And I actually know what that kid's controller was from, XBOX. Like what? Bad. Bad. Bad. Good. Good. Good.
