I've not. So, this kid was playing video games, he got a dog who did not have a leg from his mom. He kinda like shook him off and towards the end of it we find out that he also doesn't have a leg. I found that ironic there. They played ball and the dog had trouble walking and stuff. I liked how they ended up liking each other at the end, I think. And the dog was really cute and it was pretty ironic at the beginning. How the person without ... how he kinda pushed the dog off and stuff. I didn't like that at first but then I found out he also doesn't have a leg but still he shouldn't be pushing the dog off. I don't know. The mom. The dog. He was playing video games. The ball. They both didn't have a leg, a limb? They were both missing a leg, yeah. Excited for the new owner. He at first liked the dog. I felt like happy. Pretty down but I think he kinda ignored it afterwards. The boy felt really annoyed too. Kinda mad. Squealed at first but he kinda brushed that off too. He was forgiving. Still mad and ungrateful. Mad again like how the boy was so ungrateful for what he got. Happy. They were both feeling happy that they both could relate. Happy for them both.
