Which one? The last ... Despicable Me? Oh, no. He was annoyed that he got a puppy and he didn't want one. And then when he found it wanted to play with him, then he started liking it. And actually even though his leg was tore off, just like the dogs leg, they're pretty similar. No. Nothing, I guess. It was just boring. His mom. Probably a Golden Retriever. Playing video games. A ball. They both lost a leg. Alright. See, he's a little annoyed. Well, he's still a little annoyed. Happy or glad. Annoyed. I feel bored. Upset. Annoyed. Bored. Same. The same. Bored. They both have a cut off leg or a ripped off leg. Glad Glad. Bored.
