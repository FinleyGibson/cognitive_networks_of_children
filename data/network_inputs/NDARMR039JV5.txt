I have. Okay, so the movie starts with the boy playing, it looks like shoot-'em-up video games, in the living room of his house. Then his mom comes home and brings him a cardboard box that's closed, and puts it on the table in front of him, and he seems to ignore it. Then she says to check out the box. He opens up the box and he sees that there's a puppy inside, and he takes it out. It takes him a few seconds to notice that the puppy only has three legs, and he's a little annoyed by that, then he puts it on the ground, and he has no interest in it and then he goes back to playing the video games.                     Then he starts playing with it a little bit, but not kind of paying attention, but then he tends to see that even though it's a puppy with three legs, its still a puppy and still running around doing stuff. So then he gets up, and then the viewer notices that he also is missing one of his legs, or half of it. Then he goes outside and plays with the dog.
 His mother was on the telephone, she went upstairs ... yeah. Well ... I guess, as a teenage boy, it was kind of relatable to see a kid playing video games, but even though he sees that the puppy is kind of just like him and then he ... I don't know, it was just cute. It would have been cool to see what happens outside with them, and how the puppy actually reacts, and how he reacts to it running around outside. His mother. A puppy. Playing video games. A ball, red ball. They are both disabled. Really happy to be out of the box. Excited to see a new dog. Happy. He didn't seem to mind that he was thrown on the floor. He was kind of disgusted that the puppy only had three legs, kind of like his mom did that on purpose, like that. Disappointed that he threw it on the floor. Probably a little annoyed, but he still seemed happy and excited. He got up, right after that. He wasn't into it. He was kind of disgusted about it. Upset that he kicked the dog. Very excited, he likes to play. He seemed pretty happy after he realized that the puppy was still a puppy, even though it only had three legs. It was uplifting and happy.
