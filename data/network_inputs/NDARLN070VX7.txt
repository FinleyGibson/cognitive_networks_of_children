Basically, he's just playing video games. Then he didn't really want the dog. Then when he goes ... It had three legs, and he kept on stumbling. Then when he went up, he realized he had a missing part of his leg. So you find a sense of relation. I remember that he didn't really want it at first, and then he realized how cute he was. The doggo. The three-legged doggo. Some say he roams the West. The doggo. Is that an actual movie? The what? The short clip. I liked how he was playing video games. It gives you a sense of relation. And it gives you a sense of relation to the dog when he had three legs. Well, the dog kind of stumbled a lot, because a three-legged dog wouldn't be doing that. Get a tissue. You know you can pause the game to play with the dog, unless he's playing online. But online games don't last that long. His mom. The dog. Playing video games. A ball. They both are missing part of their leg. This is it? It glitched. Happy. Happy. I didn't see that he was missing a leg. I didn't know he was missing a leg. I actually thought he was going like this. I didn't know he was missing a leg. And then when he was walking around. Like, that's unethical, dude. I get the puppy was probably happy. Ugh, what is this thing? It's a dog, ew! Ew, I have no emotions. Ew. I was like, "Great response." That's an X-Box. The boy doesn't care. The dog doesn't care. The puppy was still yapping though. The puppy didn't know what was going on. What? The puppy? He was probably being like, "Notice me." Wasn't that said because he's still yapping and puppies don't really know what's going on. The boy was like ... Apathetic. Not empathetic, apathetic because he decided, no care. Wait, where are my glasses? Why are you taking so much time on an X-Box and low par console when you can just be playing with a dog? It's a dog. What's the problem with it? Get lost. That gave me the sense of relation. It's like, why did he need that then when he left, because like ... That was like the only one I could really hear. That was the ... Happier, playful, affectionate, joyful. Happy, affectionate, joyful. They both ... How was I feeling? Happy, affectionate, joyful with our relationship. Yeah.
