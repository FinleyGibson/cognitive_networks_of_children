First the boy was playing his video games and his mom came home and gave him a present. And when he opened the box he saw a puppy. And when he took it out, at first he liked it, but then he noticed that it didn't have one of his arms, he didn't wanna play with the puppy. And he just started playing back with his games. But then he noticed that he wanted to play and he was a cool puppy. He could actually do stuff with it. He decided to have fun with the puppy. And because he didn't have part of his leg, I think that when he saw that it didn't have one leg he didn't like thinking about when he lost that part. And he felt like his mom was like, "Do you think it'll run away?" I liked how at first they didn't like each other, but then he ... when the dog couldn't move around and play, when he didn't have one of his arms, it was really cool. I liked a lot of it. I just don't like that he doesn't really talk to his mom much. His mom. The puppy. He was playing video games. The ball. They both didn't have one of their parts of their bodies, but they were able to play with it and get around. Excited to play with someone. Excited like the puppy. I felt excited and happy for them. Sad and annoyed that the boy threw it down like that. Annoyed that his mom made him think of that time when he lost that part. I felt angry at the boy and I felt sad for the dog. He was just trying to make the boy to like him and when he kicked him and then I think he felt really hurt. Just really, really annoyed. Just feeling bad for the dog and kind of annoyed. I think that he was feeling excited. I think he was feeling more happy about the dog. I felt really happy.
