No. Okay, in Despicable Me or the last one? Okay the kid, so he was playing video games that his mom bought him a dog. Then the dog didn't want to play with him but then he kept saying he didn't wanna play with it and then the dog got a ball and then the kid kicked it and then the dog went to go get it and then he thought it was pretty fun so he took the ball and he went outside with the dog. That's it. No. Despicable Me I liked. The dog still had courage. The kid was being mean. His mom. A dog. Play video games. The ball. They both like playing stuff. Okay. I won't see the whole movie. The movie's long. The whole movie's long. That was it? It was just like, that was quick. Super happy. A little happy. Happy. A little sad. Sad. Mad. I felt sad. Still sad. Still mad. I feel mad at the boy. He lost his leg? How's his leg gone? Happy. Happy. Happy that the boy finally was playing with the dog.
