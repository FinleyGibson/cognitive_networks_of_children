The last one? Like the small one? No. So, first, there was a boy and he was playing video games. Then his mom came home and she put a box on the coffee table, and then he was still focused on his video game. And then she got a call, or she went to the kitchen first, then she got a call, and she went upstairs, and then he looked inside the box. And then a puppy jumped out and then he thought it was cute at first, but then when he saw it didn't have a leg, then he didn't like him, which was mean. Then, the puppy saw a ball and he took the ball and then started playing with it. Then he gave the ball to the boy, and the boy went outside and he, actually also, was missing one of his legs. So then, him and the boy, he told his mom he was going to be outside and then they played fetch. No. At the end, when they got along. When the boy liked him, liked the dog. That he was addicted to video games and that he didn't like the dog because he lost one of his legs. The mom. The puppy. Playing video games. A red ball. They both lost a leg. Mm-hmm (affirmative). Excited. Excited, too. Happy, I guess. Sad, I guess. Disgusted. Disappointed. Like I forgot the word for it, but it's ... I don't know, like ... I forgot the word. But, I guess, like the boy no, he was sad, I guess. Disgusted. Mad, I guess, too. Happy. Happy, too. Happy.
