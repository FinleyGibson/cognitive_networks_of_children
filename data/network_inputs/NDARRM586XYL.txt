I don't know how good I look right now, but ... Yes. The boy playing the video games in his house, his mom came home and brought him a gift, and he opened the gift. It was a puppy with three legs, and he was like, bothered by that, or angry. He tried to ignore it, but the puppy still played, like, was cute and was happy and clearly didn't care that he had three legs, a missing leg. Then, he kind of decided to halfway through, or kind of at the end decided he was going to play with him outside, and then he stood up and he only had one leg. I thought it was very, how it showed, sweet. How it showed the puppy after kind of being thrown to the side still having, being able to enjoy himself. I thought, I mean altogether it was good, I thought it all worked well, but I thought it was just sad that the boy was home, inside, playing video games. His mom. The puppy. Playing a video game. Ball. They're missing a leg. Both. Happy. The puppy was excited, the boy was surprised. Excited. Still happy. Like, I don't know. Like, everything he was insecure about was being highlighted. Sad. Like he was being played with. Angry. Still sad. I mean, I don't ... still happy. Like he had a friend. What's the word when you ... like the sad happiness, or happy sadness? That.
