Uh-uh. Well, the boy didn't like it, like the dog. Well, first he did and then he saw he didn't have four paws so he only had three. So he was creeped out. And he didn't like the dog. But then when he was doing silly stuff like ran into the box, he was laughing and then he started to get mad again. And then the dog passed the ball to him. Then they went outside. The boy had only one leg. That's all. Uh-uh. There was a dog in it. That he only had ... that they were missing a paw and a leg. Huh? The mom. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. They both lost a leg and the arm. I'm too tired. Liking his new home. Mm-hmm (affirmative) He liked the puppy. Twisted. Sad. Not happy. I don't know. Not happy. Not really happy. That was mean. That was mean. Happy. Happy. Pacific.
