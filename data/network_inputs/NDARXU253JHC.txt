No. What happened in the beginning was his mom came home. He was playing video games. She gave him a present. He opened the present and he actually found a dog. When he looked at his leg, he was missing a leg. He threw him on the ground, the puppy kept on coming back, he kept on pushing him away. Then he found the ball, he started smiling, but he kept on pretending he was mad. Then he went and he threw the ball, like he kicked it, but after that they started playing together. They went outside and they had fun. It turned out he lost his leg too. No. That they both had missing legs and they were very compared. There were a lot of things that were the same. Nothing. His mother. A puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They both have no leg. Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad. Mad. Sad. Sad. Mad. Sad. Very excited. Very excited. Very, very happy.
