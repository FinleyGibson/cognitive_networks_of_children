No. A boy was playing a video game and then his mom brought in a box. And when he ... When the box opened, there was a puppy inside and the puppy wanted to play with him but he didn't want to play. But then when ... at like the third or fourth try, he just went outside and played with the puppy. He had one leg. He had one good leg and one bad leg. The puppy was cute. That he just liked to stay inside. The boy's mom. A puppy. Playing a video game. A ball. They both like to play with things. The boy. Happy. Excited. Happy. Sad. Disgusted. Kind of sad. Sad. Angry. Sad. Happy. Happy. Happy. The boy.
