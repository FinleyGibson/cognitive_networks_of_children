I have no idea what it's called, and I've never seen it before. And I learned that I never seen the Despicable Me movie. Okay. Well, there was a boy with one leg. He was playing video games in the dark. Then his mom turned on the lights. Then his mommy gave him a puppy. Then he wasn't playing with it. But then he went outside to play with it, the puppy. That's all I knew from the story. Mmm.mmm. That at first he didn't play with the puppy, I'm more of a cat person. That at the end he played with the puppy. Not a bit. His mom. A puppy. What? Playing video games. A ball. They both like to play? The boy. Well, actually ... he's missing half of his leg. I think he was born without it. Okay. Ahhh. Happy. Happy. What? I was like...ahhh-what? I don't know, sad, just kidding. Mad. At first- at the beginning of the clip he was feeling happy. And at the end he was feeling sad. Disgust, because of his bad breath. I don't know. Sad. Mad. Happy. Okay Well, that's when they noticed he had ... he's missing half of his leg.                     Wait, do they-I can't believe they make jeans like that. Oh, I think they cut them. Or maybe he's just wearing shorts.
 Happy. Happy. Mad Because the boy played with the puppy.
