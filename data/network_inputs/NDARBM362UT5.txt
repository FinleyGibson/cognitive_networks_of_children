I haven't seen the million one or the dog. I haven't seen the dog one. First he was playing a video game and then the mom said, "Let me go open your present", and then he said  then he stopped the video and then he opened his present. It was a dog, and then he didn't really like the dog so he kicked him, but he noticed the dog had lost his leg. And then the boy kept playing, and then he kept looking at the dog and then he stopped the game because the dog was playing with the ball and then he ... Then he saw that he lost a leg too so then the dog played. Then he told his mom he'd be outside, and then he went and played with the dog. The end. No. I think I told the story. I liked that the dog was happy even though he lost an arm. Well I don't know. The mommy. The dog. He was playing a video game. A ball. Because they both lost their leg. Both. Okay. Yeah but I would have said it ... Happy. Happy and a little angry. Happy. Sad and he was ... He got  the boy. Angry. I don't know. Sad. Angry. A little sad because the boy hit the puppy. Happy. Happy. Happy because the boy played with the dog.
