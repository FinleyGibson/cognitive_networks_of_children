No. There was a little boy that was playing a video game when his mom came home with a dog in a box. The little boy was focused on the video game and not paying more attention to the dog. So when she barked a lot for the ball, he finally quit the game and went to give him a walk. Then they played catch. Okay. Well ... No. I do remember one thing. When his mother got home, the phone rang and he didn't know who it was. I liked the puppy and the most funny part is the short leg. Him being bored about the puppy and not playing with him. His mother. A puppy. Playing a video game. A little ball that was red. They both like one thing, and that's playing catch. When he finally quitted the game, he wanted to play catch with the puppy. Okay. Look at the short one. The short leg. Happy. Bored. Super happy.                     Bored.
 Sad. Bored. Sad. Happy. Mad. A little nervous. Because I thought he didn't want the puppy and he would kick him out of the house. That's why I was nervous. That's how they're in common. Happy. More happy. They're both same amount of happiness. Super happy.
