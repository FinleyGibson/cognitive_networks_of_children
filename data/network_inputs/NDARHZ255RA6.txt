No. So the boy was playing video games and his Mom brought him a dog. And then the dog had three legs instead of four. So the dog was really energetic and was trying to play. He was just playing video games, so eventually, he gave up and went outside with the dog and it turned out he only had three arms plus legs. The boy really didn't want to play with the dog. He just wanted to play video games. That like everyone has someone that's also alike. Like he only had on leg and two arms and his dog only had two legs and one arm. So the dog helped him like open the door and stuff. The boy was ignoring the box and he probably would have heard the dog moving around in the box, So he probably would have opened it like in curiosity. His Mom. The dog. Playing video games. A red ball. They both have a leg or an arm missing. Okay. Probably excited to get out of the box and to see that he has a new owner. Excited that he has a dog. That the boy finally found someone to play with instead of using the TV because he couldn't exactly get around that easily. Probably upset but probably the puppy thought it was kind of a game. Disgusted. Th boy probably could have put him down gently I anything. Probably upset. Probably annoyed that the dog keeps trying to come back. The boy probably shouldn't have shoved the dog. Excited. Excited. That the boy finally figured out that the dog is useful and that they kind of share the same feelings.
