No. Okay. The kid was playing video games and then his mom came home with a box. Then he ignored it for a few minutes. Then he stopped his game and looked in the box. It was a dog. Then the dog kept coming after him. Then he kept kicking it away. Then the dog found him a ball under the table, a red ball. The dog gave it to the kid, and he kicked it away, and it went into the box. Then the dog took the red ball and he got stuck in the box. Then he got out of the box and then he got the ball to the kid. The dog bring the ball to the kid and he ignored him. Then he started playing with him. He took the red ball, then he got this thing for his arm because he only had one leg like the dog did. He was kicking the dog. Well, I liked what he did when they were playing with each other. When he was kicking the dog and being mean to it. The mom. A dog. Playing video games. A red ball. Because they both don't have a leg. Happy. Happy too. Good. Hurt. Hurt too. Hurt. Hurt again. Hurt again. Hurt. Happy. Happy. Good. Yeah.
