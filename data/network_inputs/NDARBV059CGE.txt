So the guy was playing video games and he got a puppy. He didn't want to play with the puppy but the puppy was being really silly so then he played with the puppy. Um ... no not really. I thought the dog was really silly. I don't really think there was anything I didn't like. The mommy. A puppy! Playing video games. The ball. I don't really know. It looked like he was missing a leg but I'm not really sure. The boy. Mm-hmm (affirmative) Oh the puppy's missing a leg! Happy. Surprised. I thought that the dog was really cute. Why did he do that? Sad. I think he was feeling mad or something? I felt mad at the boy because it was a puppy! Puppies are really cute! I think he was feeling sad because the boy didn't like him. The boy was feeling annoyed that the puppy kept on coming back. I felt that the boy was being mean. Mm-hmm (affirmative) Happy, that the boy finally was playing with him. Happy because he liked playing with the dog. I felt happy that the boy finally liked the puppy.
