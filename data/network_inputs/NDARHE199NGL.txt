Yes. The puppy movie. First, he was playing video games, and there was a box there, and he opened it and there's a puppy. He didn't like it. He keep on going to him, and then he got up, and then he just went outside. Oh, I can remember one. The dog was chasing him when he was about to go out the door. I liked when he opened the box and he saw the doggie, because I like doggies, too. The stuff that I didn't like about the movie is when the puppy chases him out the door. Mom. A doggie. Playing games and stuff. He didn't play anything, I think. He just dropped and then he went back to him and then he keep on kicking him. I don't like him. Because, because ... I don't know how they are the same. Who was missing a leg? Neither. I really don't remember. Very, very happy. Happy. Excited. He was feeling sad. He was feeling, he was feeling mad. I felt, I felt surprised. He was so sad. Upset. Mean. He said he had to go to the race and then Great. Like he wake up and  himself. I felt happy.
