Yes. Well the boy he was playing on an Xbox One, it seemed like. His mom gave him a pet doggy that also lost a leg like him. He just didn't like it, because it didn't have half a leg. Then after somethings that happened, he got a little more interested on having fun with the puppy. Then finally went outside to play with the puppy. Mostly I didn't really like it so much. Well I mean, nothing either. Nothing either. I mean I didn't like that a kid who had a puppy would just land crash into his box and then stuck. His mom. The puppy without half a leg. Playing on an Xbox One, some weird game. The red ball he found. They both lost half a leg. Okay. Happy that he had an owner. Very happy to have a puppy. I didn't really think about how I felt. Sad. Angry. Now I did think of it. A little frustrated in my head because I mean he didn't appreciate what he got. Sadder. A lot angrier. This clip, I mean I didn't like when he kicked the puppy. That wasn't very nice. It wasn't caring for what he got. Happy that now he gets to play. Happy now. Happy that now he started to like what he got.
