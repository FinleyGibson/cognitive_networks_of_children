Yeah. The kid that was playing a video game, and that the kid was playing a video game. And his mom gave him a package, and when he opened it he saw a puppy. He got a little happy and then he just said "Get lost." Then, he actually dropped the ball. And he started going to play outside with the dog. I don't know. Why is that camera watching me? Despicable Me. I don't know. I don't know. That he was not going to play with the puppy. His mom. A puppy. Playing video games. The ball. I don't know. Happy. Happy. Sad and mad and a little happy. A little sad. Angry. Angry. Sad. Angry. Sad. Happy. Happy. Happy.
