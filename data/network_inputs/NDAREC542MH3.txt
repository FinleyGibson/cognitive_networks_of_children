A kid's playing video games and his mom comes in and drops a package, he opens the package, and a dog comes out with one leg and he kicks the dog away multiple times, and then he starts playing with him, so ...  That they both lost one leg. That he kicked the dog away. The mom. A dog with one leg. Playing video games. Had the ball. Because they both miss one leg. Both of them. Yeah. Good. Good. Good. Yeah. Sad. Mad. Surprised. More sad. More mad. More surprised. Okay. Happy. More happy. More happy.
