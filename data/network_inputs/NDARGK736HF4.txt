No. Uh-huh (affirmative). Got it. So there was a boy and he was having a new dog. The dog wanted the ball. Then while the boy did not wanted to play with him. But the third time he came, the dog was staring at him, so he was playing with him. No. It's when the boy played with the dog. That's the part I like. I did not like when the boy said, "Get lost." His mother. A dog. Playing a video game. A ball. I don't know. Mm-hmm (affirmative). Happy. Happy. Kind of happy. Sad. Fine. Kind of scared. Sad. Fine. Kind of scared. Happy. Happy. Happy.
