I have not. Sure. A kid's playing video games, violent video game. Very invested in it. His mom walks in, puts a box on the table, tries to get his attention. He gets aggressive and tilts his head away. And she goes off to take care of business. And she says you should look in the box, look at the present. He opens it and he sees that it's a puppy and he's like, "Aw this is so cool." And he picks up the puppy and he realizes that it's missing its front left leg. And immediately he's like, "Ew gross." And I think he literally drops it on the floor. And the puppy is determined obviously. But I think it's more just it's playful and innocent. So it's trying to play with him, playing with the ball. He's watching it and he's trying not to get invested in it. And he watches it for just a couple of minutes. And he's like, "Alright fine." Wins him over. And he picks up the ball. And then when he stands up he reveals that he's missing a leg as well. So, and then it ends with him going out with the puppy to play. It's a puppy (laughs). It was very realistic, just to the puppy. They didn't try to make the puppy any particularly smart, amazing puppy. It was just a puppy. Like that's how I'd imagine that a puppy missing a limb would act. Just like a regular puppy. The kid was a jerk. It irritated me watching him drop a puppy. Well I'm imagining his mom. It's not said. Is it said? Yeah you can't tell. But no, it is said. It's his mom. A puppy missing its front left leg. Playing a violet video game. The puppy was playing with the ball. Well they're both disabled. I guess we call it a leg for the dog as well. So both. Okay. Excited. Also excited. Happy. Surprised. Disgusted. Disgusted. Still surprised. Disgusted. I'm gonna double down on disgusted. Alright. Happier. Accepting. I felt the kid got off too easily. He kicked the puppy twice. Both.
