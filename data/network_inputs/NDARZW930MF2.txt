No. Okay, so there was a boy who was playing a lot of video games. And his mom thought he was on them too much, and she got him a puppy, which was missing a leg, and the boy thought the puppy was odd. And he didn't really like the puppy. And he just continued playing video games. And then, the puppy brought him a ball, and he threw the ball. And then the puppy did a lot in a box, and then ran around, and eventually got the ball back to him. And then, the boy got pretty annoyed. And he eventually realized to appreciate the dog. No. I liked the story. How short it was. His mom. A puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They both have disabilities. Happy. Happy. Happy. Upset. Sort of weirded out that the puppy was missing a leg. I felt bad for the puppy. Very sad. Angry at the puppy. Still bad for the puppy. Happy. Happy. I felt happy that the boy learned to appreciate the puppy.
