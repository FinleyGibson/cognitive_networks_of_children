The dog part? Well, I saw it one time. Well, both of them had their leg, like, chopped off, like they didn't had a leg. Both of them were playing ... they were like having like fun. Yeah, also, her mom, this ... say, "A package came for you." She put it on the couch, and then he opened, and then the dog popped out. Me? Well, I liked it when they were like playing outside. I didn't like when the kid was hitting him. The mom. The dog. He was playing his game. The ball. Because both of them have like a thing they can play with. Both. Why is it going blurry? Was that actually the end when they were playing? Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Mad. . Wait. What part? Oh. He just got like, surprised, and then when he saw the missing leg, then he get like a little angry, and then he pushed him over. He felt mad. I felt surprised? Puppies felt happy. The boy was feeling happy. Happy.
