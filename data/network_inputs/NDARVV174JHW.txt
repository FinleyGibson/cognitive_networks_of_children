What? The last one? Well really there was a boy and the mom came in from the door and then just saw a dog. Then he had a package and there was a dog in it. At first he didn't like it. Then he did. Then I realized he loved his at the end. I don't know. Same thing. His mom. A dog. A puppy I mean. What? He was playing a video game on there. A ball. I don't know. Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Not happy. Not happy. Still happy because he was always happy. Not happy. Not happy. Happy. Happy. Happy.
