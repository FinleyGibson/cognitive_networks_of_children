No. Um, the start of the whole movie? Okay. A kid was playing a game on the TV, then his mom came in, and put a box on the table in front of him. The mom went upstairs, he opened the box and there was a dog with only three legs, and he tossed it aside, because he didn't like it and he continued playing the game. Then the dog found a ball under a table, and wanted to play fetch with the kid. So, he nudged the ball to the kid and the kid kicked the ball, and the dog went after it. Then the dog brought back the ball to the kid, and he kicked it again into a box, and the dog ran and stumbled, and kept stumbling. Then, went into the box and the box flipped over on the dog. Then, the dog was struggling to get out of the box, then finally got out of the box. Then, the kid saw how fun the dog was, and wanted to play fetch with him outside. And, the kid turned out to only have one leg. Um, no. I liked the dog part. Um, I don't know, I liked how it was animated. I kinda liked the storyline. He was mean to the dog. Um, he didn't wanna play with the dog. I didn't like that they were missing legs. Um, that's it. His mother. A puppy with three legs. Playing a game? A ball. They're missing a leg. Happy. Excited. Good. Sad. Disappointed. Upset. Neglected. Upset. Upset. Happy. Happy. Good.
