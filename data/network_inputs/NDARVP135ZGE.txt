What? I have. I didn't really remember right now. So he's playing video games and then ... mommy came home and then there's a box. And then he gets really excited that it was a package for him. And then he opened it, and it's a dog and then the dog brought a ball for him. And then he put the ball in his pocket and smiled. And then he told mom that he's going outside. And then he would, he going to play and he threw it. And then he ran and he kept his little feet but he was going home, too. He was walking with them, so probably he's going home. Yeah, I just remember the whole story, but it's the whole story. Wasn't it? That the puppy just popped out of the box and scared me. That I didn't saw his video game when he was playing. The mom. A dog. He was playing video games. Ball. They are both gonna play something. Yeah. Did you saw buttons under the computer? Happy. Happy. Frustrated and happy at the same time. Yeah. That's not a boy because that's his for his puppy got before. Happy, still. Angry. I mean, no. No. He was feeling disgust and angry. Yeah. I got lazy. I don't want to do another one. He said, "get lost". Probably otherwise he might have , that would be exciting. Happy, still. Angry and disgust, again. Every feeling except for happy. And especially disgust. Is it drop at his house still. I forgot to tell you that the puppy, he popped out of the box. Happy. Happy. Happy. And sad because it was so beautiful.
