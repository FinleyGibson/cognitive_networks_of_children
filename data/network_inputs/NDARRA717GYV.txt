No. Well, basically what happens in the middle was that there was this kid that was like sitting down and then the mom told him to, the mom was trying to get him to go outside and then she brought a box in. And then he still wanted to play the video game. So then he was interested in the box. He wanted to see what was happening in the box. So then he opened the box and then it was a dog. He thought it was cool at first, but then he didn't like it. So then the dog tried to play with him, but he didn't want to play with the dog.                     So the dog kept trying and then he kicked him a little bit, shoved him away. But then the dog kept trying to play and then he got used to him and he kept on smiling 'cause the dog was being a dog, basically. So then he got up, the dog found a bone and then he was playing with it. He tried to find the owner to trying to find the boy to play with it. And then he tired of his video game and played with the dog. But then when he got up, he was one foot. He had only one foot and I thought that was pretty cool because a dog can get somebody that has one foot, one leg or what do you call them? Handicap? Handicapped, a person that's handicapped to do those things.
 I liked the ending that the dog, the owner liked the dog and started to play with him. That he kicked him and he didn't like the dog. His mom. The dog. He was playing a video game. A ball. They both liked to play. Happy. Excited, surprised. Wow. Sad. Angry. Mad. He still wanted to try, I mean sad actually, mad, but he still wanted to try playing with him. Annoyed. Mad. Happy. Happy. Happy.
