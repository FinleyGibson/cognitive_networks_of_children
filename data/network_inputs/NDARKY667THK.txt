I think I have. Yeah, actually. Okay, so there was a boy playing video games and it seemed like he never stopped playing video games and the mom came home with, I think she said it was a coffee machine or something. I can't- I couldn't really hear well, but she was like, "Okay, open the box, open the box," and he did and there was a dog and he was really excited. And then he picked up the dog and saw that it was missing a leg and kind of pushed it aside and was really rude towards it. And the dog was super happy, brought a ball to him, and then the boy finally kind of gave in and they both went outside. That's kind of it. Well, it was really sweet and meaningful, because obviously the boy was having a hard time because he was missing a leg. And then he was able to create a bond with the dog. I guess the beginning was kind of sad. I mean, it was hard to watch the beginning. The mom. A dog. Playing video games. A red ball. They're both missing a leg or a paw or whatever. Okay. Excited and happy, at that point. He was also excited and happy. Good, like the boy finally found someone. Well, before he knew that- yeah. Sad, I guess. Annoyed that his mom gave him a dog without a leg. Really sad and disappointed, I guess. Still sad. Still annoyed and frustrated and stuff, I guess. Same, just like disappointed, frustrated at the kid. Super happy and satisfied, I guess. Really happy and like he had a companion now. I felt really happy, but... I don't know, you know, just happy. Excited to see them together. Okay.
