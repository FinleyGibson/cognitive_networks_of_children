No. The mom came home, and she put a box in front of the kid. The kid said, "mom." Then, the phone, I think started ringing, and she went to go pick it up. Then, he opened the box, and there was a dog in there. He said to the dog, "Get off me." Then, the dog fall on the floor, and I think he found a ball and  it outside. And then, the kid said, "Mom, I'm going outside to play." That there was a dog. And the kid said, "mom," because he was playing a video game. That he didn't play with the dog. Mom. A dog. Playing a video game. A ball. Because they're both, I think, boys. And- They're both kind of almost like siblings. Happy. Excited maybe. Hm. Sad. Mad. I felt mad at the boy. Even more disappointed. More like angry. Mostly disappointed. He was playing Xbox, too. Happy. Mad because his leg was broken, I think. Sad.
