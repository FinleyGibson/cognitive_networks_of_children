No So the boy was playing a video game and his mom comes into the house with a box and she gives it to him but he doesn't look at it cause he's really interested in the video game, and then she says "Why don't you stop playing and look at the present I gave you?"                     And then she goes upstairs and he puts down his video game and he opens the box and he sees a puppy and for a second he likes it and he holds it but then he's just like "yuck" and he throws it on the floor and then he kicks it and he says "You've gotta be kidding me." And then the dog tries to get the boy's attention but he just goes back to his video game.
 Well, I basically liked all of it so ... His mother. A puppy. Playing his video game. The ball. Um ... Excited. Excited. Kind of sad that he threw him out on the floor. Um well I don't really know how to say  so but he was like, he didn't really like the puppy. He wanted to play with the boy and then the boy just kicked him away and so he was sad. Like he didn't really want the dog. Happy and happy. Happy.
