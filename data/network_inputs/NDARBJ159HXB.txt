No. This boy is getting a present. It was a dog. The dog wanted to play with him. He took out this rubber ball. It was red. He kept trying to chase it and play fetch. Then, the boy gave up and went out. I saw he had crutches. That's it. His mom wanted him to stop playing video games. The cute dog. That he was sorta being mean to the dog. His mom. A puppy, or a dog. He was playing video games. The puppy was playing with the ball. They both feel they want to play with something, but someone else doesn't want them to play with it. The boy. Okay. He's feeling excited. He thought it was cool. Like the puppy only wanted an owner. The boy he mighta been wanting a puppy. Okay. Confused. He didn't realize that the puppy, he really didn't want it. That the puppy was being neglected. The puppy must've been sad. I think that he was feeling the boy didn't want him. He didn't want the puppy. The boy didn't really want the puppy. He was feeling like the boy actually wanted him again. The puppy wasn't that bad. The boy liked the boy after. The boy.
