Yeah, I actually saw it on YouTube once. The mom brought a dog that didn't have a leg and the kid didn't have a leg. At first, the kid was ignoring the dog, but then he started to like him. Not really. The last one? That he started to like the dog after he hated him. It was kind of short. It could have been longer. His mom. The dog. He was playing his video game. A ball. 'Cause they both don't have a leg. They both were. Happy. Happy. Happy. Disappointed. Angry. Disappointed. He was still feeling happy, because he just wanted to get his attention. He didn't want to be bothered. It felt weird, because he just started to like him. Now, and just started being- . Happy. The same. The same.
