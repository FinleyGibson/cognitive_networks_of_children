Yeah. Like what movie? Oh. He was playing video games and then his mother ... He got a box and then there was a dog in there but then he was being mean to the dog, to the blue dog. Then when she ... When he found the ball then when he was walking to him he started playing with the dog and going outside with him and playing ball with him. No. When the dog came and when he got the box. That his foot, one of his foots were missing. His mother. A dog. He was playing video games. The ball. They both like each other. Okay. Happy. Kind of not happy. Happy. Um, sad that part because he threw him on the floor. Happy. Sad. Sad again. Happy again. Sad. Happy. Happy. Happy too.
