No, but that character, the dog looked familiar. I feel like I saw that character before, but not the boy. Okay. The boy is playing his Xbox 360. The mom brings in a box. The boy doesn't know what it is. It's a dog with three legs. He gets mad. He's like, "Get lost." To the dog. The dog wants to play. Then, a few times,  the boy finally says yes. He's like, "Alright." He brings crutches or something and I thought to myself, I was like, "Wait a second." I find out he only has one leg too, just like him. I found out that was a little messed up because he didn't like his own kind. The ball was red. He was playing an Xbox 360 game. About how the dog and the boy got along in the end. How the boy was like "Get lost" to the dog, and the dog didn't do anything to him at first. The mom. A dog, a puppy, to be exact. Playing Xbox. A ball. The leg. He felt happy because he got a new owner and also the boy felt like that too. I just said it. I'm like, "Oh, yay. The dog got adopted." Sad. Angry. Pretty pissed off. Sad. That the dog was a piece of shit. Sorry. Sad. Happy. Happy. I felt happy. Wait, hold on. I felt happy because we actually found out, in that clip, that the boy also had no leg neither. I'm finished? All of it?
