No. Well, the boy was playing video games and then his Mom came with a package and then opened the curtain and he's like, "Huh?" And then he was like,  and then he had the puppy picked up and then when he saw it had one leg he kind of you know, threw it off to one side.                     But the puppy was very determined. When he's upside down.  he's like  and run towards it and then the boy kinda got interested but he was trying not to admit it to himself. And then, well, then the dog, then he kicked a ball back into the box. The dog ran into the box, tumbled a little bit and then when he got in the box, fell on it and landed the box on him. And then he got the box off and they played, then the boy got crutches and went out to the yard and then they played.
 And that's when it ended. It's hard to say. It's hard to stay  when you haven't, you know, just hard to talk about stories sometimes. I like how it had a happy ending so ... That's probably what I thought was the best part. Probably the fact about the kid throwing the dog. That's probably the only part I didn't really like so ... His Mom. A puppy. Video games. A ball. They both were missing one leg. Both. Very happy. Very happy also. Very happy as well. Very unhappy, but very determined at the same time. Disgusted. Probably a little freaked out like, "What the heck is he doing?" Very unloved. Probably same as the first clip. Disgusted. Terrified, like, "What?" Okay.
