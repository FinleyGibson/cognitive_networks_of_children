I don't know what the movie was about. The last one that happened? A boy had a dog and a mother. The boy was playing a video game and the dog were in the bucket. The dog rolled over and then they were outside. No. The thing from the first beginning. I liked every part. His brother. A dog. Playing video game. A ball. The boy. Happy. Mad. Happy. Sad. Mad. I don't know. Sad. Bad. Happy. They were playing catch. Happy. Happy. Happy.
