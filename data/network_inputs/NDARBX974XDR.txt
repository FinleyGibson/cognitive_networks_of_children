No. Okay, so basically it was about a disabled child playing video games, then his mom comes home with a deformed dog as well. He didn't accept it, so basically he's not accepting what happened to it. He wants to feel more normal so he's pushing away the dog instead and then, later on in time, he grew toward it. No. They both went outside and played. There's nothing I didn't like. His mom. A deformed dog. Playing video games. A ball. They were both playing with something. Happy. Happy. Happy. He was still happy either way. He was mad. Sad. Mad. I mean, still happy. Mad. Sad. Happy. Happy. Happy.
