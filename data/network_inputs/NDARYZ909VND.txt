The kid didn't have a leg. So, he was handicapped. And, it was, he got mad and just pushed it off of him and off the table. Well, he wanted to play with the red ball and he went and played with it. They went outside and played with it. Um, ... being, um, ... some of the things I liked about the movie is that it was like, it made me kind of sad, because it was a puppy, yet it ... Him being mean to the puppy. The mom. A puppy! Playing on the TV. Playing games. He was playing with the ball. They both don't have, ... he's a, the puppy doesn't have an arm, and the boy doesn't have a leg. Happy. Happy. Very happy. Confused. Mad and shocked. I felt mad because he threw the puppy on the floor, and it's not right to do that when they are hurt. Sad. The boy was feeling ... angry still, and disappointed, and that's all. It felt bad. Happy! And excited! Happy and excited, too. Happy, and I felt warm inside.
