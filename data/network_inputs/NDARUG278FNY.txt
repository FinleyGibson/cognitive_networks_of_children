Yes. Which one are you talking about? The first one or the second one? Oh, okay. Yeah, I saw how ... So, I seen that movie before cause off YouTube and stuff and I seen the boy and the dog, they have something in common and stuff. They both are like handicapped and yeah. No. I found it interesting, just from the kid that plays games all day and then he goes outside to play with the dog that has the same thing in common with him. There wasn't a whole lot that I didn't like. I also didn't like the fact that he was being mean in the beginning, kicking the dog. His mom. A dog. Playing games. A ball. They're both handicapped. The puppy. All right. Happy. He seemed like he was okay about it but I don't think at that exact point, he didn't like it. I thought it was cool cause then I looked closely and I saw how the dog was handicapped with him. Before, I saw that the kid was handicapped, I was just not looking at the bottom of it. Little sad but it still seemed happy. He was mad, disappointed. Probably because the dog was missing a leg and stuff. I think he took a little too rough on the dog. He didn't have to throw the dog and stuff, you know. The puppy was still happy, I still could tell, but it was probably like, "He kicked me but I only just get back up and try annoying him again." He was still ... I guess he was mad. He seemed mad about the fact that his mom got him a puppy instead of maybe like another game or something like that. Also disappointed that he had to throw the dog and kick it. Happy. He probably felt a little bit better because he got outside now instead of sitting in the house all day. I feel a little bit more happy about it.
