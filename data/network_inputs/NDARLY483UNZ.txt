Nope, I haven't. Okay. So, the mom brought in a three legged dog from the street, and at first the boy, he didn't like it because he only had three legs. And he was like "Get lost." But then, he started to grow on him because he was cute, and then he went to go play fetch with him outside. And then you see that he also has only one leg. Not really. I thought the ending was cute. How he treated the dog in the beginning. The mom. A puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They both have a disability. Both. Very happy. At first, happy. Pretty happy. Upset. Disgusted. Disgusted. Probably confused. Mad. Still disgusted. Excited. Happy. Happy.
