No. Okay. So in the beginning, this little boy was playing video games and then his mom came back and then she gave him a little box and then it seemed like he didn't really care and then he opened the box and then there was a puppy and he was like Oh cool, but then he realized that the puppy didn't really have an arm, like he was like, ugh, and then he kind of like shoved the dog away ... But then the dog found a ball and he wanted to play with the ball so he got it under the furniture and then he started to play with it ... and then the boy realized that he wanted to play ball and then the dog came over and gave the ball to the boy and then the boy actually was like oh cool we can go play ball outside and then they went outside, the dog opened the door for the boy and then they went outside and then the boy actually had a missing leg and he had crutches. That he actually played with the dog. That he shoved the dog away. The mom. A puppy. Playing video games. The ball. Because they were both missing something. The boy. Okay. Happy. Kind of happy but then he realized that ... Excited. Like, cool. Like, a little sad. Like, ugh, like not really interested. Sad, like ... Sad, like he was like ... Well, he didn't really care since like, he like, still tried to do it again, and he found the ball and then he was happy again. Still, like get lost and stuff ... Like oh my God, it's sad, like if I had I would be like, I would be like so happy that I got it. Happy that they actually got to play. Happy. Happy. The boy.
