No. Well he was playing the game and then his mom came in. And then his mom said, "Stop playing the game for a few minutes and looked for  Garcia." And then he like kicked the dog. He got mad for a few minutes and then finally the dog wanted to play with the ball. And then he just put it in his pocket and then went outside and the dog opened the door frame.                     And then he had his, his things to walk. And then the dog went under him and then they were playing.
 His mom going upstairs. That they got along at the end. That he was like, like rude to the dog and mean. The mom. A doggy. Playing the game. The ball. They both like to play. The boy. Okay. Happy. Happy. Happy. And then in like the middle he started getting- Mad. Like, like mad. Like uncomfortable. Like he doesn't want it at first. Sad. Unplayed with, like he wasn't playing with nobody. He was alone. He wanted to play. Like a little disappointed that his interrupting his game. It's a little rude to the dog and a little mean, meanful. Okay. Happy and the dog was being so nice even though he was being mean to him. Happy. I feel comfortable.
