When the mom came home and the boy was playing video games, the mom brought a surprise home for him, and the boy wasn't listening, and then, when he opened the box, the boy, there was a dog, and it jumped on him. And then it licked him. And then the boy didn't like that, so the boy kicked him. And then, the dog found a ball. And then, the dog wanted to play the ball with him, but then, the boy kicked him again. And then, he asked him again. And then, he finally played outside with him. I liked the dog and how the boy played outside with the dog. When the boy kicked the dog and did not want to play with him. The mom. It was a dog. He was playing video games. The puppy was playing ball with him. Because the dog had one leg missing, and the boy had one leg missing. Both. Very happy. He was feeling happy too. I thought it was cute and funny. He felt upset because the boy threw him. He didn't like it because the dog licked him. I thought it was cute because he licked him, but I kinda thought it was sad, because he kicked him and threw him. I thought he was feeling ... When he was on the ground, he felt upset, but then, when he got up, he felt very happy. The boy said, "No, get out of here." It was very sad. He's feeling very happy, because the boy played with him. He was feeling very happy and excited. It was very cute and very nice. I wish I had a puppy. Both.
