Which movie? It's about how he was disabled, and all he did was play video games. So, they bought him a dog that was disabled also, but that can help him navigate to different places. The dog liked to play fetch, with the red ball. I liked how they were similar, the dog and the boy. Nothing. The mother. A dog with three legs. Playing video games. A red ball. They both like to play, but it's different. Happy. At first, the boy was feeling happy, but when he saw only three legs, he thought it was offensive. He will adapt. The boy will adapt to the dog. Still happy. Mad. I don't know. I felt like it was very unnecessary. At first, sad, and then tried to get attention. The boy felt mad. Again, unnecessary. Very, very happy. Happy, and confident. Soothing.
