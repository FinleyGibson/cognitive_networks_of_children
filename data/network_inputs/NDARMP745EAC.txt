Nope, I haven't seen it. What was it called? The Present. I've never saw that before. Well there was a kid, who I believe couldn't like, walk, so he needed the two things that help you walk. He was playing a video game on there, and he was really excited. His mom told him to open the present, and inside was a puppy. The puppy, at first the boy just like, kicked away the puppy, didn't want anything to do with it. Then eventually, he decided to go outside with the puppy, and that's when I found out he couldn't walk on his own, because he had that thing. That's basically where movie ended. The story? Do I remember anything else? His mom came home with the present, told him to open it. I remember at one point, the puppy went under like the ... The cupboard, where they had all that stuff. He went under there and got a ball, and then one point he was playing around with a box. The boy decided that he wanted to play with him. That's when the boy went outside and told his mom that he was going to be outside with the puppy. I think it was funny. I don't know. His mom. A puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They both ... I don't know. Okay. Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad. Like, angry. Confused. Sad. Angry. Sad. Happy. Happy. This might feel weird, but sad. I think it's sad that he only had one leg. What happened to his other leg?
