Okay. He was playing a video game, and then his mom gave him something, like a box. And then he found a dog. And he thought he had a collar, which he didn't, so he put him on the floor and kicked him. And then he found the ball. And then he started playing with it. And then they went in a box. Then he went in the box. And then he hit the wall. And then he got out of the box. And then he started laughing. And then he just played his video game again. And then he gave the ball to him. And then he started laughing again. And then he picked the ball up, and he got up. He went outside and he played with him. No. That he was playing with him. And he hit the wall. That he kicked the dog. Twice. That's it. His mom. A dog. Playing a video game. A ball. Because the puppy had three legs, and the boy, he didn't have his leg too. Yes. Happy. Happy. Happy. Mad. Sad. Mad. Mad. Mad. Probably. Mad still. Mad still. Happy. Happy. Happy. That was quick.
