No. In the beginning, there was a boy playing video games, then the mom bought in a box fr him. He opened it up and then there was a dog in there and then he went to play with the dog outside. I remember that he had one leg, had a broken leg. The dog when he was in the box and when he wants to play outside. Him kicking the dog. The mom. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. That's a hard question. Sometimes, I have this in a test, like a math test, how is it the same? Because they like each other? Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad. Mad. Sad cause he kicked the dog. Sad. Mad again. Sad.                     Can't believe he has one leg.
 Happy. Happy. Happy.
