No. Okay. So, it opened with the boy sitting out on the couch playing video games. His mom walks in with the box, and he put it down on the table and told him to open it. And he didn't want to open it because he seen the note at first because he was playing video games. And he eventually opened it, and there was a dog. And he got excited at first, but the dog was missing a leg. So, he got mad, so he put the dog on the floor. And the dog found a ball, and the dog kept bringing the ball over to play with him. Then, eventually, he took the dog outside with the ball to play. We find out when he gets up from that couch that he is also missing a leg. I liked how the dog kept trying to play ball with him while he was on the couch, even though he didn't want to. When he kept pushing the dog away because he didn't have a leg. His mother. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. They're both missing a leg. Both. Okay. Happy. He felt happy, too, because he got a dog. Tired. I guess it made me happy, too. Rejected. Upset because he was missing a leg? It made me upset that he threw him away just because he was missing a leg. Upset. The boy was angry that he was trying to play with him. It made me feel bad for the dog. He felt happy that he wanted to play with him. Happy that he got to go outside because he seemed upset. Like he was just playing video games in the house by himself before. It made me happy that they were both happy at the end.
