Yeah. The boys' mom brought home a dog and it only had three legs. At first, he didn't like it, but then he started to like the dog. Then he went outside and he had only one leg, and then played outside. He pushed the dog away. He didn't really want to play with the dog. I like the dog. It was a nice dog. I didn't like how the guy was treating the dog at the beginning. His mother. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. They both have one leg missing. Happy that he had an owner. He thought the puppy was cool and he was happy with it. Felt good. Kind of sad because the boy didn't like it. Mad at his mom that she got him that dog. I felt bad for the dog. At first, he was feeling happy because he wanted to play, but then the kid pushed him away so he felt sad. He didn't want to even look at the dog. Again, I felt bad for the dog. Happy. Happy because he fell in love with the dog. I felt good for the dog. He finally got an owner.
