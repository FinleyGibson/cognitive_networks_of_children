No. Well, this boy, I think, moves since there was a lot of boxes, and his mom gave him a package and there was a dog in it, and he threw it on the floor because he was too busy playing video games, and stuff. So, then the dog kept trying to get him to play with him, and that the end they played, but I think the boy broke his leg, or something, because he had crutches. That his mom told him to stop playing video games. That it includes a dog, and I think it's really sweet. That the boy didn't play with the dog in the first place, because the dog's more important than the video game. His mother. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. They both like to play. Okay ... If this thing will ever load. Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad because it just dumped him when he was really happy and then ... Kind of mad that his mom gave him that present. Sad for the puppy. Kind of sad, because he didn't want to play with him, and he said, "Get lost," which is very mean. Mad that his mom gave him that present. Sad and sort of mad, at the boy, for saying "scram" and treating the dog like it's a rock or something. Very happy that he's finally playing with him, and not ignoring him. Happy, and sort of mad that he treated the dog that way. Happy for the dog and the boy, that they made up and are friends.
