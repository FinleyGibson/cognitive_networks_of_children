No. The last movie was short. I only saw a little bit of it. In which one? Oh, but I only saw a little bit. That was the whole movie? Okay. There was a boy and he was playing video games. Then his mom gave him the present. He saw that the dog didn't have a hand over here. He had a missing leg. So they started playing together. No. But I do know they were playing with a red ball. When he saw that the dog didn't have a hand over here, he threw the dog on the floor. His mom. The dog. Playing video games. The red ball. They both have a missing part of their body. The puppy. I mean, both. Happy. Excited. Happy. Sad. Disgust, because he said "Ugh." I felt bad for the dog. Even more sad. Mad. I felt like the boy was being mean to the dog. Happy. Happy. Happy.
