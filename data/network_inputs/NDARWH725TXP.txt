No, I never, ever seen it before. So what happened in the beginning was. It was that the boy was playing video games. And then the mom walked in with a box, and she put the box on the table. Then she went upstairs, she answered the phone, then she went upstairs, then the boy was looking at the box. And he opened it. And a puppy came out. So the puppy jumped onto him then he kicked it. Then when he kicked it, the puppy tried it again, then he kicked it again.                     Then the puppy saw a red ball underneath the cabinet. Then the puppy got the ball, and then he brung it to the boy. Then the boy ... Then the puppy wanted the boy to throw it. 
 And then, the boy and the puppy got along. So then the boy took the puppy out to play fetch. Some things I liked about the movie was that, when the boy met a new friend. What I did not like about the movie was that when he kicked the puppy. The boys mom. What was in the box was a puppy. He was playing video games. The puppy was playing a ball. The puppy and the boy are the same because, puppy was born with three legs and the boy was born with one leg. Both. The puppy was feeling happy when he saw the boy. The boy was feeling, excited. I felt excited to. What I thought, was I thought that he was going to be nice to the puppy. The puppy was feeling sad. The boy was feeling mad. When I watched that part I felt sad, because the boy threw the dog on the floor. The puppy was feeling sad. The boy was feeling mad. I felt basically mad. Because the boy should not kick the dog. The puppy was feeling excited. He was feeling excited. I felt excited because now the boy met a new friend that he ... Now he has a friend that's just like him.
