No. Okay.                     So in the beginning, mom comes home. So the kid is playing video games, and then she has a gift in a box for him and then he opens it up, and it's a dog but it's missing an arm. So then he looks at the dog and then he notices that it has one arm and he pushes it away. It's upside down and it finds a ball. It takes the ball and it kicks it to the kid's shoe, and then he still pushed the dog away. And then he wanted to go outside so he went outside with the dog, and then he threw the ball around. And that's basically all.
 No. That they had something in common. That the dog had one arm. The mom. The dog. Playing video games. The ball. 'Cause they were both doing activities. Both of them. Okay. Happy? Happy until he figures out that the dog was missing an arm. Happy. Happy. Sad. Mad. Mad. Sad. Mad. Mad. Okay. Happy. Happy. Happy.
