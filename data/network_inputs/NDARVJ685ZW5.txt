Yes. So there was a man and there was a boy crying because his balloon popped so- The boy ... What boy? The movie when he got his puppy? When he got- When he got his puppy, his breath smelled yucky. He didn't want to play with him. Well, he changed his mind and then he played with him. No. It was just half. I just liked the Minion movie. I didn't like the other movie. I just wanted to keep watching it. I didn't like the puppy. He didn't like the puppy smell. No. That was yucky. Her mom ... His mom. A puppy. He opened it and then he saw a puppy in there. Then he just lift up his ... He got his puppy and then he smelled his breath and then it smelled very yucky. A ball. It just saw a ball under something and then it was right like he was playing with ... The puppy was trying to say, "Can you play?" He want to play, but the boy was playing his game because he don't have that much time. Because the mom choose it. Uh-huh. (affirmative) I don't know. I don't know. Okay. I can't hear it. Happy. Happy too. The next part when he just smells his breath. He said that he smelled his breath and then it smelled yucky. Sad. Because the boy throwed him on the floor. Mad. He feel mad about the puppy. I felt mad too at the puppy. He was still sad and then when he just found the ball then the boy just kicked it and then the puppy was getting it. He was going to get it and then the puppy was just trying to say, "Pretty please can we just play for ?" He was trying to say that. I think a little happy. Yeah. A little happy. About the puppy because he said please. Well when he was playing with the puppy I felt happy again. Can we watch the video now? That was a nice movie. Can I watch it again? The puppy was feeling ... I don't know. They were feeling happy, and then the boy was feeling happy too. Because when they were happy they were playing fetch. I was feeling happy, and then I only think that that's the end, and then that's the good part. Yay.
