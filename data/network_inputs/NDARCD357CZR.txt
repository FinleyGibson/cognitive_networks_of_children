Yeah. Yeah. The dog had a missing leg. Listen. The boy was sitting down playing video games and his mom gived him a box and he opened it and it was a dog and he saw it, and he had one missing leg, and he played with the dog. And the boy just played with the dog. And the dog and the boy went outside. The boy just hold the ball and threw it. When the dog had the missing leg. Because the boy did not like the dog. His mom. A dog. Open the end. He just saw the dog. The ball. They have missing legs. The puppy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Mad. Happy. Excited. Mad. Excited. Happy. Happy. Happy.
