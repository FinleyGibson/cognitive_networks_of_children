No, I have not seen it before. Okay, so this boy who was playing these video games at home until his mom came home and bought him a present. The present was a dog. But then he noticed it had only three legs so he threw it on the ground. When the dog tried to play with him, he kicked it away. He didn't like it, until the dog tried to find the ball, and the dog passed the ball to the boy. And then the boy started to smile. And then he went outside to play. Not really. I liked how at the end he actually decided to play with the dog because he also had three legs, I mean two ... one leg, I should say. I didn't like how he just threw him on the ground and then kicked him away the first time he saw him. Because I feel like he should have known how the dog felt because he only had one leg. His mother. The dog. He was playing on his video games. A red ball. The puppy has ... They're both missing a leg. Both He was happy. He was also happy. I actually go scared 'cause the puppy came out of nowhere. I wasn't expecting that. A little bit sad. He was angry. I was angry with the boy, because he threw it on the dog. Confused. Still angry. I was still angry at the boy. Happy. Happy, as well. I was kinda happy, but still a little bit angry because what he did to the dog before.
