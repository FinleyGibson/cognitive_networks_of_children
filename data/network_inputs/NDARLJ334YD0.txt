No. Wait, the Minion one? No, the dog one? The beginning was the boy playing video games. The middle was the dog came. The last part is the dog and boy, they were friends and they had fun together. The boy was being mean to the dog because he saw the dog and he saw the broken leg ... not the broken leg, the no leg. That the boy and the dog were having fun. That the boy kicked the dog away from him. His mom. The dog. Playing video games. A ball, a red one. Because they both didn't have a leg. Happy. Beginning, happy. Sad and happy. Happy. Mad. Sad. I saw his face and he was happy still. Mad. Sad. That's why I said they both got something in common. Happy. Happy. Happy.
