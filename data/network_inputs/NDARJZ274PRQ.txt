No. Kinda yeah, just now. Well first he was playing video games and his mom came home and gave him a box of a dog. So then he kept on playing until he saw ... Until his mom said I just gave the box to him but he never opened it yet. Then he opened it and when he saw he picked the dog up. And he saw the whole body and he was missing one leg. Then he threw him on the floor because he was missing one leg too. So then when he kept ... the dog found a ball and kept on playing with it. Then when he saw him, because they like ... I forgot what the word was called. They are comparing, they're like the same. So when the dog was playing and the kid he found out that he was missing one leg and he was too he went outside to play with him too. No. That at the end he went to play with the dog instead of just keep on playing his video games. That he kept on playing his video games instead of opening the box as soon as he got it. His mom. A dog. Playing video games. The ball. The red ball. Because they're both missing one leg. Happy because he took him out of the box. Happy but as soon as he saw him ... well happy at first because he didn't seem him yet. I didn't see the part when the dog was missing ... like I didn't see the dog was missing the leg so you really don't know. Sad a little. Angry because his mom gave him a dog with a missing leg. It was sad. Kind of. Maybe a little angry. Angry. Angry too. Happy. Happy. Happy.
