No. Okay. The pup, he was playing video games. Then his mom brought down the box. Then his mom opened the blinds. Then, he couldn't see, so he moved over. Then he moved the box. Then up, then his puppy came out. Then, the puppy was like, "Attack," like pulled on to play with him, but he was kicking him around. Then the puppy found the ball. Then, he wanted to play with him. Then, the boy was kicking the ball. Then he  he should go outside and play with him. The puppy was rolling around. That they both had one leg, like one leg missing. That the person was kicking the puppy around. His mom. The puppy. Playing video games. The ball. They both had one leg missing. Both. Happy. Like surprised. Sad. You see, he threw him. See, he threw him. Mad, like sad because he wanted to just play with him. Angry. I feel sad because he threw the puppy, and he wanted away. Sad. He doesn't really care because he's playing his stupid video games. Mad. A little bit angry at the boy. Happy. Happy. Happy.
