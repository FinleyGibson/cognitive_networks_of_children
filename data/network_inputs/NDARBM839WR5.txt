No. I didn't really enjoy it, I ... Well, it starts out with this boy. He's playing video games. And then his mom comes in and gives him a box. In the box is a puppy with three legs. And then he's annoyed by it. And eventually he's like, "Okay, I'll, I'll ... " and it turns out he lost half his leg. And that's basically all I saw. That's really all I remember. So- I don't like or dislike anything. It was really just meh. I don't, I already told you. I really didn't like or dislike anything. It was really just meh. His mom. A 3-legged puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They both lost half a leg. Nice. I guess a little . I was just like, "Meh, meh, meh, meh". Bad. A little . Yeah. Again, meh. I was pretty much meh throughout the whole movie. Puppy felt bad. Boy felt angry. I was pretty much meh throughout the whole entire movie. Good. Good. Still meh.
