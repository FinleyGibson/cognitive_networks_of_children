Unspeakable me? No. The boy was playing video games and then the mom came home with a box. The mom put the box on him. The boy opened the box and he found the puppy, but he didn't want to play with him. Then he decided he wanted to play with him so he went outside to play. No, that was it. When they went outside to play. Nothing. The mom. The dog. Just playing video games and then he opened the box. Him, but he wasn't playing with him. No, first he didn't, but he found a toy. A ball. Good. One was playing and one was playing video games. Happy. Happy. Happy. When he threw him on the floor? Sad. Mad. Happy. Sad. Mad. Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy.
