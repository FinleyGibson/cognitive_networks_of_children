No. So the kid was playing the video game. His mom gave him a box. There was a dog inside of it and he opened the box. He saw a dog. The dog saw a ball and then the kid wanted not to play with him and then at the end he did. No. I liked the dog. His foot. His mom. A dog. Playing the video game. Ball. I don't know. They both like to play. Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad. Angry. Sad. Mad. Mad. Mad. Happy. Happy. Happy.
