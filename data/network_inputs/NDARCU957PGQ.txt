Despicable Me? The dog one, I've never seen it before. The boy was playing a shooting game. And, his mom gave him a present. And it was a dog. The dog saw a ball, went to it, got it. Well, first it bumped its head and then he got the ball. Gave it to the boy. The boy threw it and the dog got it. And at the very end the boy went out, the boy threw the ball, the dog ran back to him. That's the story. No. That the dog bumped its head the first time it was trying to get the ball. That's hilarious. That the story did not start with the dog in it. It was like the dog had to come into the story through, like late in the story, like in the second of the three minutes. The boy's mom. A dog. Shooting game. Ball. I have no idea. They play together. No. Happy. Happy. I thought it was crazy. Sad. Sad. Mad. find what I did. I said can you guess my answer by what I did. Like falling back. I thought it was crazy. Okay. Mad. Mad. Mad. Mad. Mad. Mad. Mad. I felt so dumb. Okay, this is the last clip? Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy. I have no idea. But why are you video taping this? Arhhh.
