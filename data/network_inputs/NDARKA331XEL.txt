No, this is my first time. There was this boy who got a puppy with only three legs. One of its legs was missing. And then he was playing video games and that he shoved the dog off, and then he thought the dog was funny. And then he went outside to play with the dog, and I was shocked that he was like the dog. He was missing a leg. It was kind of sad. That he finally played with the dog. That he kept on shoving him away. His mother. A three-legged puppy. Playing video games. The red ball. Because they were both missing one leg. Both. Happy. Really happy. Excited. Heartwarming, heartwarming. Right now? Sad and neglected. Angry. Angry. When he got shoved? Sad. Still angry. Sad. the clip we just watched. Happy. Happy. Heart warmed.
