Mm-hmm (affirmative). A dog only has three legs and the boy has one leg. He was and then he kicked the dog and he kicked the dog, and then when I saw the dog only had three legs and when I saw the boy only have one feet gone, he only had one feet walking. Because he got a weight like the old people. No. That was it. They played video games. He kicked the dog. Momma. Dog. Kicked the dog. A ball. Cause they only got one leg at the same time.  Happy. Happy? Happy. Angry. Angry. Angry. Angry. Angry. Angry. Hi guys. Happy. Mad. Happy.
