No. The boy was playing a game, and then mom came home with a gift for him. He opened it up. It was a dog, but he only ... he lost one leg. The boy when he stand up he lost a leg. So they're like twins. No. They played outside. That the boy and the dog both lost their legs. They looked like twins. I didn't like anything. I did not ... I liked everything. Mom. Dog. Playing games. Ball. They lost one leg. One clip? You see? Lost a leg right there. Happy. Saying, "What a puppy." Good. Sad. Angry. Sad. So sad, because he kicked it. "Really? I don't want it." I don't know. See? He lost a leg. Why does he have those two on his arms? Why do they have them on his arms? Why do they have that on the arms? Why? Happy now. Happy. Happy.
