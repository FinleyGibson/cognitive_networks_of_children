Okay. At first a kid was playing a video game, then his mom came home and brought a present. Then after a few minutes he opened the present and it was a dog, but he didn't like it because a paw was missing. Then at the end ... wait before the end, then he just ignored him and started the video game again. Then when he saw ... he wanted to play outside so they both played outside. Um... the mom's phone rang. That they got along and made a bond. How he didn't didn't like the dog. The mom. A dog- or a puppy. Video game. A red ball. They both have a leg missing. Okay. Happy because he had an owner. He said, "Whoa." So a little happy. Sad. Mad. Sad because he threw the puppy. Happy and sad because happy because he wanted to play and sad because the owner didn't want to. Upset. I don't know. Happy because finally the boy and the puppy made a bond. Happy too. Happy.
