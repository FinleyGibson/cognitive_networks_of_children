What kind of was it gonna be? Yeah, that was good. No. First the kid was playing the Xbox, and then the Mom came home and put a box on the front table, opened the blinds. Like where he was sitting, like on the front, like right here, and he was sitting right here. So like, he was on the couch, and then was like a little table to put the box on, and then the mom opened the blind. Then he was still playing his Xbox, and then the Mom said to open the dog, the something, like I guess she said there was a dog in there, and then the phone rang and she went upstairs. Then he opened the box, and then he picked it up and looked at it. He didn't have a, didn't have a arm, so he threw it. Then it was barking, and it went on there, found the ball, and then he was playing with the ball. Then the kid came out. The kid was walking with his crutches, because he didn't have, he didn't have a foot, and they played ball outside. Huh uh. That there was a puppy inside the box, 'cause I would be happy even though it did have a broken foot. That he threw him. That he, that he actually kicked him, too. The Mom. A puppy. He was playing his Xbox. The ball. Because they both have broken foots. Both of them. Okay. This is still recording? Is it going to go on YouTube. Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy, but once the boy saw her he threw it, and then the puppy was feeling sad, and he was too. Sad. Sad, too, 'cause he threw him. You're not supposed to throw a puppy.  See, he kicked it. Sad. Mad. Mad, too because he kicked him. You shouldn't kick a puppy. He'll die. Okay, but in real life it would really die. This one feels sad, too, because they both, and he actually doesn't have a foot. I don't know how that would feel. Why did he have crutches then? He should have a wheelchair. People have wheelchairs. Happy. Happy. Sad.
