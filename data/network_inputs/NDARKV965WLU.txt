No. I thought it was bad. It had monsters with a lot of eyes. Uh-huh (Affirmative). No. In the beginning ... He got a new pet and the dog was in there and then ... his mom got the box and the dog was in there and he ... and the man forgot to turn him into a dog and not an alien dog. Then he went outside to go for school. I liked the dog. I liked the boy playing the video game. Uh-huh (Affirmative). I did not like the way the dog had only one arm not touching the floor. His mommy. A dog. He was trying to finish it then he was opening it and then he saw his two hands. Then he was staring at it and he did not want to play with him and he did not want to play ball with the dog. Then he wouldn't want to play outside slow. In the beginning he wants to beat the video game. He was happy and he really liked to play ball and he wanted him to throw the ball and he wanted to catch the ball. The boy doesn't like the dog because he has two arms not touching anything on the floor because it doesn't have paws like the other feet on here. Uh-huh (Affirmative). The man has to make the dog into a dog, he's supposed to not make it into an alien. Happy. Mad. Because his paws were not the same. I was just staring. He was very happy. Very, very mad. He was very mad that the man just made that dog into an alien. I feeled happy to it and I started watching it. Super very, very happy. Super very, very, very, very, very mad. I was still happy and I was still staring. Very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very happy. Super happy. Very, very, very, very, very, very,  mad! Because he wanted that dog and he saw that dog on the computer. He saw the hand on the paw and then he got that dog and he bought it then he was happy and he . Then he liked it but he did not like it and his mom gave the box to him when he was almost done with his video game. I feeled happy still. Still.
