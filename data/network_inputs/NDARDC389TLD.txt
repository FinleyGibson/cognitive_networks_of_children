I have.  several times. Here's what happened. A dog wanted ... a teenage boy wanted a mom ... a teenage boy lived with his mom and he had a surprise for ... the mom had a surprise for her son. She was playing video games and he opened the box revealing a puppy. Then he was drinking Lay's potato chips, eating Lay's potato chips and the puppy went ... there was a red ball underneath the cabinet so the puppy bumped his head. So he went to get the ball and he shaked. Then the boy realized that he loves puppies. The boy called to his mom that ... got his crutches and told mom that they'd be outside and went to go play outside with the puppy. And that's the end of the three minute movie. I don't know. I liked it when teenage boys like me, like play video games. I know I didn't like when the boy told the dog to get lost, when the boy told the dog to get lost. The mom. A puppy. He was playing video games. A ball. Am I done? They're humans. Neither. Either. All right. Does it tell the whole story? Happy and playful. Surprised. I liked it. I liked the whole movie.  He knocked the box off the table. Upset. Upset because he doesn't like puppies. I liked it.  Oh. Dropped something. Upset. Careless. I don't know. Remember, stories have beginnings, middles and ends. Got it. So I think he has a injury, a severe, a fatal injury. A severe injury, I think. He does. The name of the ... the title was "The Present." Happy that the boy wanted to play with the puppy. Happy. They tried to tell the whole story? Happy.
