Yeah. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe. The cute little movie, when he opened the box he was like ... and he was missing an arm but he looked at him and he had soft heart and he said... He throwed the dog on the floor and kicked him. And then he was ... He went outside. So then at the end, he said, we need him. The door. And at the Minions, I'm waiting on the guys that keeped the door, they wanted like ... They sleeping there. But somebody picked them up and then, that's where they're home. So in that's the dog that I see'd when they were wheeling him into the house. And they moved, and spooned . And then the girl went down to the guards like then they broke her pony, so on the Minions, then the father said they are cousins, and then ... Oh. Yeah. And he throwed the ball. And he hold on to it because he wanted to play outside with the puppy. And the last part, when we are about to leave, they like to go to play outside. And the dog too, and they are fetching. And then ... And I remember something like ... It was like ... There was a girl and she said "open the box." But he was too busy playing the video game. And that was the puppy inside it. And the puppy jumped up, and the boy was watching the video games because he didn't open his box. Somebody would come on, his dad and they both have a box. And they opened the box, and there was a puppy and a card inside. There's two pets. Then, they took them back to the pet store. But they bought them again. They went to the pet store and got them. I like, one of my favorite parts was when he jumped up. Yeah. The one I don't like, about the movie, its like he's sewing his soft paws and I don't like soft paws. Mommy. The puppy. Watching the video games. But he was watching the video games, and he went about and he didn't opened. I guess he got ... like. 'Cause they both like to play outside. The boy. Okay. Here. Look, watch this. He jumped . Watch this. . Happy. And the boy was happy. But watch this. Watch this. What happened he stopped , and then he will push him. Like push him. And push him on the ground. Like kick him. He was kicking him a lot. Good. Oh, this is the boy. He was so close. There. And then he do this. Sad. I think sad. Angry. He- He don't like his present. But at the end, he like his present. Good. And he kicked him. And he kicked him. And he said ... Sad. Ang- He's said, "Get away little stinker." Sad. Good. Okay. And then he said, "Mom, we will be outside." And then- Happy. Happy. Happy.
