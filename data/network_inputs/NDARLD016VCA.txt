No. Well, so first the mom came home and the boy was playing his video game and the mom gave him a present and he didn't want to open it just yet and then the mom ... someone called the mom and she went upstairs. He paused his game or turned it off and he opened it. He saw the dog and he took it up, but he thought really nothing wrong with it. So when he took it up he saw one arm and he didn't like it because its not normal and he ... like the dog started to play around and the dog saw the red ball, playing with it, fell in the box probably, well he did. Then he got out and the boy started to realize how much he had in common with him. Then in the end the boy was actually with no leg and so its like the dog with no arm, he had no leg but then he started to play with him. He told his mom, "we'll be outside." And he was playing catch with the dog and they had so much in common. Um, that's really it. I liked how they meet, they weren't talking but they were expressing feelings. I like how it was all how in common you can have a relationship with a dog. They were so close so, I liked how it was like that, so yeah. I had ... I didn't like that he was getting ... he didn't like how the dog was looking with one arm. That was really only it because you should love a dog no matter what, how it even looks you should still treat it well. The mom. The dog. Um, he was playing his video game. A red ball. They both have like some, they both don't have a body part. The dog don't have an arm and the boy don't have a leg. Okay. Happy. He was first feeling happy. He was like oh wow, so cool! So happy. Upset, but happy still. Not happy, he was angry. Pretty upset. Upset. Still furious. Still upset. Um... he was feeling happy! He was a little excited. He was happy. I was so happy because now they have something in common and the boy has someone to play with and always cherish it in his heart.
