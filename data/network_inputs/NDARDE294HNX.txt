What? No. In the beginning, the boy wasn't doing anything but playing, and his mom told him to go outside but he didn't want to. And he got a puppy. Yeah. At first, he didn't like the puppy since he had only three legs, but then finally at the end, he stopped playing his game and realized that he needs to go outside. And I noticed that he, his arms are broken, and the dog is missing an arm. It shows how cute the dog was. I didn't like how the boy was ignoring the dog. The mom. A dog. He was playing. A ball. They, something is both gone. The puppy. Excited. Happy. I was like, okay. Sad. Weirded out. I felt sad. Sadder. I don't really know how to describe it. Sadder. Happy. Happy. Happy.
