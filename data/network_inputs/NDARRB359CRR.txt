No. Okay. So, they both have two broken legs. The boy didn't want to play with the dog and he kicks the dog away, then the dog decides to play with the ball, then they both go outside. He opens the package and finds a dog, a little puppy. What I liked was the puppy was cute and ... yeah. I don't know. His mother. A puppy. He was playing Call of Duty. The ball. The puppy and the boy are the same because they both have broken legs. I think both of them. Okay. Happy. Happy. Happy. Still happy. Mad. I don't know. I think the puppy was feeling happy. Mad. I don't know, maybe happy. Happy. Happy. I felt happy.
