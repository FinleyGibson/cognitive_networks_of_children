No. There was a boy playing video games and then the mom came in with a box. And, he didn't know what it was so he just kept playing. And then, he couldn't see so he had to move the box over. And then, what he did was he was getting focused on the box kind of and then at one point he opened it. And then, a puppy jumped out of the box and he found like a toy and he went to it. No. That there was a puppy. I have a puppy at home. Not really anything. The mom. A puppy. He was just playing video games. A toy. A red ball. They both like to play. Okay. Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad. Mad. I didn't really like that part. No. They were both feeling bothered. Bothered from the puppy because it was trying to his video games. Didn't like it. Okay. That puppy was feeling happy. Happy. The puppy was also feeling playful. Yeah. Happy.
