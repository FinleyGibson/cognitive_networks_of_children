His mom came through a door with a box, and his mom set it on the couch, and he was playing a game, and then he opened the box, and it was a dog, and he didn't like the dog. Then he started playing with the dog. He told his mom, "Mom, we're outside." That's it. No. That his mom brought him a dog. The dog had a missing leg. His mom. A dog. Playing his game. Him and the ball. Because they both eat, and they both drink, and they have eyes, and they both have nose in here. Happy. Happy. I don't know. Still happy because it found the ball. Upset because he saw the dog had a missing leg. Kind of sad. Because the dog had a missing leg. Still happy. Angrier. I had no feeling. Happy and excited. Happy because he was playing with the dog, and his mom brought him a dog. Happy. Because ... I don't know.
