No, I haven't. Okay so the kid was just intensely playing a video game. Like just loves video games and like he was kind of grumpy that his mom started interrupting him, and she got him a present. And he stopped to think about opening the present instead of playing his video game. So he opened it, and it was a dog. But once he noticed it only had three legs instead of four, he threw it. And he just didn't like the dog. He got really angry, and the dog just kept coming back to him because the dog liked him. And then in the end when we saw him go over to the door, we noticed that he also had one leg. He was missing a leg, just like the dog. Yeah. Also in the end, he started to like the dog. I personally liked how the dog and the boy had the same thing in common. They were missing a leg. The fact that he discriminated against the dog. Meanwhile, the dog was just like him. The boy's mother? There was a puppy in the box. He was playing video games. The ball. They were both missing a leg? Both. Okay Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy until he got thrown. Happy until he found out the puppy was missing a leg. Partially annoyed, partially happy. The puppy was feeling sad. The boy was feeling annoyed. Definitely annoyed. Very happy. The boy felt happier. This part I felt just really happy.
