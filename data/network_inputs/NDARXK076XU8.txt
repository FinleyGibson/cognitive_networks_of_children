No. So the first part of the movie was like the kid was playing a video game. And he put down the box and he opened the box and there was a dog. And then he gave the dog away. I also remember that at the end he took him out for a walk and he took the dog for a walk to throw the ball. I didn't see enough to know anything that I liked. I think movies, I like movies so much that I don't usually take a favorite part from a movie. I don't have things that I did like or did not like because I just take movies like I like that or sometimes I don't like that. The mom. A puppy. Playing a video game. A ball. They both like to play. I didn't really like it. I didn't like it. But then like throws down the puppy. Sad. Angry. I don't feel anything, I don't do ... I just think like that's a good movie or a bad movie. Okay. He ate a bag of chips. See he ate a bag of chips. Like uncomfortable. Because the boy's getting off and like Upset. Because he didn't want that puppy. I told you. He just gets out of the door. What happens after he gets out the door? Happy. Happy.
