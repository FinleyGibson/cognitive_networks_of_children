No. There was a person and who was really addicted to playing video games. His mother tried to distract him. Then he opened up a box and he saw a dog. The dog found a ball, so he kept playing with it. He forced the kid to go outside, and he threw the ball to him. No. I just like dogs, so ... I don't know. The mother. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. They're both addicted to something. Happy. Happy. A bit happy and ... Not that good because he threw him. Not good because he wanted to do something, I guess. That it's not fair that he's hurting the dog. In the beginning of it, he wanted to play and then he didn't. Upset. He wanted to play the video game. . Happy. A bit happy. Happy.
