No. It began ... The boy was playing a game and then his mom came in and gave him ... and put a box ... The boy didn't know what was inside it. She put it on the table, then she opened the blinds and he couldn't see.                     Mom went upstairs. Before she went upstairs, she told him to open the present I got you. He was still playing the game and he thought about it, then he opened it. It was a dog and then he picked it up and he saw the arm, that one of the legs wasn't there. He put down and kicked it. 
 I like that they were ... I liked the movie because they were both the same. They were both missing a leg. I didn't like the beginning. How the boy, kicking the dog. The mom. A dog. Playing the game. The ball. They're the same because they both have a leg missing. Okay. Happy. Happy because he got a new dog. I felt like they had a connection when he first opened the box. Yeah, it was good. Upset a little bit because he just threw him on the floor. The boy was feeling mad because he thought the puppy was perfect, not like him. I felt bad. The puppy was feeling like he wanted to play but when the boy kicked him, he felt like "who's gonna play with me?" So he felt like he had no one to play with. The boy was feeling upset. I felt ... I don't know. The puppy was feeling happy because he had someone to play with. The boy was feeling happy now because he didn't like the dog at first, but now he's starting to like the dog for who the dog actually is. I felt good.
