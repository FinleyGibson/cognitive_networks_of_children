My favorite ... Yes. Yes. Well, he felt a little nervous and he kicked it and ... But then they got along and then he got outside and played together. And what else you know? They're gonna have the best birthday ever! And then things happen and the ending, they were happy forever after. Yeah. Well, he gave him a present and the dog's head just popped right out. And then he felt so happy and ... But then he kicked the box and the dog fell over. Yes. Well, that ... Well, then ... Maybe that they had to be ... Get along with the boy was busy doing his video games. When they ... When he kicked ...That was a funny part. And when he was busy playing his video games. And then they got along and they were friends. And they lived hoppity happy ever after. Because they did not get along, but then ... They didn't That's what I didn't like. His mom? A puppy! He dropped the dog on the floor and then he rolled over. And then he got up and he wanted play but the boy didn't care. He was busy playing his video games. His ball! They're different. They're not the same, but they are the same when they get along but the same when they don't get along. They did get along at the end. But they were a little not meant to be each other. Okay. He opens it. And then ... Excited! Happy, but then he didn't think that that was the kind of puppy he want. He was wanting a black ... I mean a brown ... White checkered puppy! With a small nose. I feeled happy and in love, but I feeled sad when they didn't get along. A bad surprise. Ugh! Discuse! Discuse means disgust! A little bit, a little bit, a little bit smelly! Yeah! That the dog was unclean. Then he kicked him! Sad. Upset cause he didn't get a clean puppy. He got a dirty, icky, smelly puppy. It made me angry and I wanted me a kick the boy right out of the T.V. screen and I will talk to him and hit him if he won't apologize to his puppy friend. Yes. And then at the end they went to go outside ... Why does he have the present? Love! Happy. So much better.
