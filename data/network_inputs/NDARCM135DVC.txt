No. The boy was playing a video game when the mom gave him the box. At the end of the video game he stopped playing and then he opened it. It was a puppy but he didn't know it only had three legs. The other one was missing. Then he threw the puppy on the floor and then the puppy found a ball and then it bumped into the little closet. Then at the end the boy didn't have a leg so he was on crutches and then they went outside to play with the ball. No. That there was a dog and it was a hurt one. I care about it. That's it. The boy was lazy like my brother. The mom. Puppy. Playing a video game. Ball. They both have a leg missing. Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad. Mad. I care about the puppy. Very very sad. Super mad. Very, very, very cared. Very happy. Happy. Happy.
