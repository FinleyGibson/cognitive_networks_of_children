What? The Despicable Me one? No I haven't seen it. Well basically, this one boy, he was playing video games and his mom got him a dog. The boy just wanted to keep playing video games and then later he saw the dog was playful and stuff so  decided he wanted to play with him outside. No. I liked that the ending was a happy ending because he wanted to play outside with the dog. Something I didn't like about the movie was that the boy shunned the dog away and just wanted to keep playing video games. His mom. A dog. He was playing video games. A ball. They're both handicaps. Think the puppy was feeling excited. The boy was also feeling excited about having a dog. I felt, both satisfied and angry, because of the different . I think that the puppy was feeling sad that the boy shunned him away. The boy is feeling angry that the dog was handicapped or something. I feel angry because even though if a dog is handicapped you shouldn't shun it away. I think the puppy was feeling sad because he wanted to play with the boy but the boy didn't wanna play with him. The boy was still feeling angry and just wanted to play video games. I felt angry because the boy was still shunning the dog away. I think the puppy is feeling happy that the boy finally wanted to play with him. I think the boy is also feeling happy 'cause he was playing with the dog. I feel happy because, the boy didn't feel angry anymore and wanted to play with the dog.
