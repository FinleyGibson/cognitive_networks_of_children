No. First the boy was playing video game, then his mom came in, he got a dog, he didn't want to play with him, but in the end he wanted to play with him. I liked the puppy. He was cute. I didn't like that he was being mean. His mom. The puppy. Playing a video game. A ball. Because they were both happy. Excited. Excited. I felt happy. Sad. Angry. I felt sad. Sad. He was feeling annoyed. A little sad. Happy. Happy. Joyful.
