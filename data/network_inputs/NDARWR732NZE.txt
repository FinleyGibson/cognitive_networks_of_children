I didn't see the present. The little boy, I don't know his name, his mom just gave her a box, and he opened it. It was a dog with a lost leg. And he didn't like it. And the puppy found a ball to play with. He wanted to play with the boy, and he kicked it, and the puppy brought it back. Then, the boy got outside with the ball and threw it to play with. Done. No. I don't like it, really, kind of. I don't know. The mom. The dog, the puppy, I mean. Playing the video game. The ball. They have a lost leg. Happy. Happy. What? I don't know. Any feeling. I don't know. Sad. Bad. Well, I don't know, same feeling from before. Sad. happy or sad, I don't know. Mad. I don't know. Same things. I don't know. Happy. Happy. I don't know.
