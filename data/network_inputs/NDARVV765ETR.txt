I've never seen that. So a little boy was playing his video games, and his mother brought in a present for him, came home from I would be guessing workplace, and brought a present. It was a dog with it's left front leg missing. The boy kind of shunned it away a little bit, avoided it, until I guess found this place with the dog, and a relationship. It even shows the boy had a leg missing, too, his left leg. From the end, they went outside and they were playing with each other. No. No. It was pretty emotional. Yeah. I don't really like anything about it. His mother. A dog. Was playing video games. Hmm? A ball. They both legs missing. Hmm? Both. Okay. Happy. Happy. I felt the same way when I got my first dog. I was pretty happy, excited. Wouldn't really know. Upset. Almost disgusted. Well, the puppy, most of the time, he felt joyful and wanting to play with the boy. But I would say the boy, too, still shunned him away. Mad, upset. Sad. Okay. He was happy, whatever. I felt like he found this place with the dog. I was almost like a happy sad. It was emotional.
