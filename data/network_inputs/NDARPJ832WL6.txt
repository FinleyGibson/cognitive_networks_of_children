No. So, first he was just watching TV, and then his mom came home, and then his mom just gave a big box and he opened it, and then a dog popped out. Then he first thought that he was cute, until he saw how the part of his body, the leg, looked like. Then he's like, "Ew." Then throws a ball, and then the dog just falls, and then they play with the ball, and then they go outside. I found out that he has missing part of a leg, and then they play outside. No. That at the end, that they were friends. First he didn't like the dog, but now they are best friends. I don't know. His mom. The dog. He was going on TV and doing video games. The red ball. They're both missing a part of their leg. Both. Good. Happy. Good. When the puppy got threw down, he looked a little sad, but I know he's going to be happy again. Like he didn't like how the puppy looked, then ... I felt bad for the puppy. Happy, and then sad again. He still got mad at the puppy. Sad, again, because I felt bad, because the puppy's keep on getting throwed on the ground. Now the puppy's feeling very excited and happy. Good. Good.
