Yeah, I have. Yeah. My sister showed it to me on YouTube. There was this boy that was playing video games. His mom comes in and gives him a present. He opens it. It's a dog, but he sees that it's missing a leg. He gets mad, and he throws it to the ground and continues playing his video games. Then, the dog sees a red ball, and it starts chasing it. He sees it chasing it, and he thinks it's funny. Then, he picks up the ball and he takes it outside. It shows that he's also on a single leg. When he was watching the dog play with the ball, when he thought it was funny, he tried to pretend that he didn't think it was funny and went back to playing his video games at one point. The animation was really good. Yeah. What are some of the things you did not like about the movie? Cool. Who gave the box to the boy? What was in the box? What was the boy doing before he was given the box? What was the puppy playing with? What do the puppy and the boy have in common? Let's watch a short clip from the movie and talk about it. It takes a second to load. It seemed really excited. At first, he seemed excited, but then he realized it was missing a leg so he felt angry. Then, at the end, he felt happy again. I thought it was cool. It still seemed excited even though it got thrown to the ground. He started feeling angry and disgusted even. I'm not sure. Maybe it reminded him about his leg or something. It kinda surprised me. It seemed like he was really mean. Just 'cause it was missing a leg, he threw it to the ground. It seemed to still feel really excited and happy in that part. He seemed to be angry still, really angry. I was kinda scared for the puppy's safety. Really excited and happy. He seemed happy as well. I was happy. They got a happy ending and stuff. You're welcome.
