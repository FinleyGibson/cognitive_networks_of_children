First, there was a boy. Then his mom gave him a present. Then when he was playing a game, he didn't want to open the present, but then he opened it and then he found a dog. Then he didn't care about the dog. Then when the dog was happy to see him, he kept looking away from it and didn't play with him. Then when the dog made the boy happy, then they went outside to play. That you should always care for others. I have a question. Why did the boy and the dog didn't have the other legs. Nothing else. I just liked that part. I didn't like about that movie is that the boy didn't care for the dog. His mom. The dog. He was playing his video game. The ball and then he was playing with the ball. Because they both have the other legs not on. Happy, and the boy was feeling happy. I was feeling a little bit friendly, but I was feeling a little bit happy and friendly. Now the boy is mad. Happy. Mad. I was feeling a little bit sad. Happy still, and the boy was feeling mad still. Sad still. Mm-hmm (affirmative). Happy, and the boy was feeling happy too.
