Well, in the beginning, there's a boy, he was playing video games. And his mom found a present for him. And the present was a dog. And in the middle, he was- he picked up the dog and realized it didn't have a paw on one of the legs. So, he just started to play more video games 'cause he thought like the dog wouldn't really be that much fun because it doesn't have a paw. And then in the end, he was watching the dog, and then he realized that the dog's really cute and he decided to get him. And I guess the dog probably reminded him, the dog reminded him of him because he didn't have a foot or a leg. Um. The dog was like playing around and hitting things. I liked the dog, 'cause it was cute when he was running around and banging things. I liked the whole movie. His mom. A little puppy. He was playing video games. The red ball. Because, they both don't have a foot or a paw. Or the boy doesn't have a leg either. He was feeling like excited because it had a new owner. He was feeling excited, 'cause he said, "Whoa," and he was really happy. But then he saw the puppy didn't have a leg. And then he just threw it on the floor. Um. I felt that was a little rude. A little sad. But he was still happy after that. A little upset, because the dog didn't have a paw. A little funny. Like a little happy because he's rolling around. Mad It was pretty funny. Happy, because the boy started actually playing with him. Happy. Happy.
