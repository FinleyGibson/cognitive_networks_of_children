No. Like, it was a boy. He was sitting. He was playing a lot of video games. He was just so focused on everything and so then basically, his mom tried to say "Go outside. Go outside" and then she put a box there, and he broke his leg. His leg was broken. He opened the box. Saw a god that also's leg was broken. He liked it at first but then he didn't cause he wanted to play his video games so he just put it down ... And so then the dog started playing and the dog wanted him to play with him but he was being so mean, and then finally he just wanted to go outside. So he went outside and the dog came and just like tried to help him and tried to like him but he didn't like him. Yeah. Um Yeah. I liked the dog. He was so cute. I didn't like that the boy was so mean to the dog. His mother. The dog. He was playing video games. A ball. They both broke their leg. Okay.                      
 Happy. Happy. Happy.                     
 Sad. Annoyed. Sad. Um, I think he was kind of confused, because like, he was like happy but he was sad at the same time. Annoyed. Cause like the dog is always getting in his way. It's so annoying. He just wants to play. I felt mad at the boy. Happy. Happy. That was really sweet.
