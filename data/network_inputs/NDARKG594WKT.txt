No. There was a dog...kid playing video games. And he was a brat, and he got a dog and he wasn't grateful of it because it had one leg. And then he had one leg and he went out to play with it, and it ended there. His mom got it for him. I liked the animation, I guess. The kid was stubborn. It was animal abuse. The mother. A puppy. Playing video games. A ball. A red ball. They both had an amputated leg. Both of them. Okay. Excited to meet his new owner. Happy. I didn't have much feelings. I was tired. So that part of the movie, how do you think the puppy was feeling? And how do you think the boy was feeling? And how did you feel when you watched this part? Here's another one. The puppy was feeling a bit energetic cuz he wanted to play with his owner. But, then he felt declined. The boy was feeling stubborn and angry. A bit more aware, I was tired. And that's probably the same answer you're gonna hear for like ... Happy, cuz he wasn't left alone anymore. Happy, cuz he ... I don't know why you feel happy all of a sudden. I was asleep.
