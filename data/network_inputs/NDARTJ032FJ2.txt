Yep. Like five times. Well, the boy ... you recording right now? Okay. The boy was playing video games and his mom came in and told him to ... what do you call it ... to get outside. Then she went upstairs because she was on the phone and told him to open a present. There was a dog missing a hand and the boy picked it up all happy and whatever. Then he realized the dog didn't have a hand, so he threw it on the floor and was disgusted with it. Then the dog was upside down, and he realized the ball under the ... what was it ... like a cabinet? It was a red ball. He threw it to the boy, and the boy kicked it away in the box. And the dog went to it but he tripped twice because he didn't have a hand. He was in the box. The dog toppled over him. Then the ball went right in front of the boy. The dog tried to get to him. He tripped once or twice. And it got to him. Then ... where am I up to? ... then the boy decided he wanted to play with the dog. Then at the end you see him on his crutches and he's missing half of a leg. Then he went outside with the dog. He said "Mom, I'm going to be outside." Well before you thought the boy was nasty because you didn't know he didn't have a leg or whatever. Then at the end you realized he's the same as the dog. He threw the dog on the floor. His mom. The little dog. He was playing video games. A red ball. They're both missing half a limb or a whole limb. Happy and loved ... Like, finally someone wants me. He was excited and happy. I don't know, I felt it was very cute. Like, typical. Wow, this guy changed his mind in two seconds. Disgusted. Sad. Angry. Annoyed. It mad me angry at the boy ... ... and sad for the dog. Overjoyed and happy. Yep. And the boy. Yeah. The boy felt love for the dog. I just felt happy for the both of them.
