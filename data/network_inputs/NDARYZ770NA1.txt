Yes. Kid was playing Call of Duty. His mother comes home with a present. He opens up ... He keeps playing and then she says, "You should really get some sunlight." And she opens the shades, he winces with the light. Then he says, "The present's for me?" Then he opens it up and the dog jumps out and he picks it up and he's like, "Awe." But then he looks at I think a right leg and he's like, "Ah, disgusting." Then he just threw it on the ground. Then it saw while it was upside down, he saw a ball and he grabbed the ball, took it to him. He kicked the ball away, but the dog thought he was probably playing fetch and went into the box. He jumped the box and the box fell on top of him. Then he moved around and then he got out. Eventually the boy went out to play with him. Then he realized that the boy only has one leg. I had a one leg dog too. I was like three. It died. Yeah. Cool. No. That there's a dog and he's playing Call of Duty, because I play that game a lot. He threw the dog on the ground. The animal abuse. His mom. A dog with the three legs. Playing Call of Duty probably. A red ball. They each don't have ... they don't have all their legs. Okay. Excited. Excited. Blank but sad. Sad. Mad. A little sad. More sad. More mad. Sad. Excited. Happy. Happy.
