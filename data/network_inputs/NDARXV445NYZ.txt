No. First he was basically kind of focused on his video game. Then his mom came home and then she brought home the dog without a paw ... without a fourth paw ... and he wanted to play. He went and go got the ball. Then the dog owner just threw it to him in the box. Then he got stuck in the box so everything came out and then he really liked to play with the dog. They were kind of similar because he didn't have a leg ... and the dog didn't have a paw. Then they went outside to go play with the ball. That's it. They ... he was ... really focused on the video game because that is how I would be going if my mom ever got me an animal. That he was way too focused on the video game and wasn't that much focused on the dog. His mom. A dog. Playing a video game. The red ball. The dog didn't have a paw and he didn't have a leg. Happy? Happy. I was kind of excited. He was feeling link of bad because he didn't have a leg either. Kind of sad. Sad. Kind of mad. Sad. Happy. Happy too because he realized they were the same. Kind of happy.
