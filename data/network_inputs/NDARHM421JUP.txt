No, I never. What movie? I do not ... I do not remember, which one you're talking about. Oh yeah, I remember. I only remember when he got a new puppy. And when he was playing his video games on the T.V. And then, he kicked the ball. Then the dog chased it and then he got up with the dog and went outside. Nope. Cause there was a dog. I do not like ... cause the dog do not have an arm or the kid did not have a leg. The mom. The dog. Playing video games, and I already said that part. The red ball, and I also said that. Cause the dog did not have an arm and the boy did not have a leg. You're using that computer? Joyful cause he found a new family. He was very happy when he got him, but then when he saw him without the arm, he didn't feel happy and he throw him. I felt happy that he got a new dog, but I did not feel happy when he throw the puppy. Because my brother would be so mad if he watched that movie cause he loves puppies. We have a puppy at our house. And a cat. Sad. Angry because that puppy didn't have an arm. I felt sad and anger at that point. Not excited that time, only a little bit. Still, angry and he still wanted to play his video games. Still sad. Okay. Happy. Happy. Happy.
