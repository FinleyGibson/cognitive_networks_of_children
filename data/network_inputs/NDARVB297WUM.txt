Well, the puppy ... the president was a puppy and the puppy was missing a leg and so was the boy. That he liked video games. That the puppy and the boy were both missing a leg. That the boy wasn't treating the puppy as nice, but then he liked him. His mom. A puppy. Playing a video game. A ball, a red one. They're both missing a leg. Happy. He was feeling mad at first, but then he was happy. Happy. Happy, but he was feeling a little bit sad before when he threw the puppy on the floor. He was feeling happy at the end. He was mostly feeling a little upset that the puppy didn't have a leg. Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy.
