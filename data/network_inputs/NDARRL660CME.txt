No. There was a boy and his mom gave him a box. When he looked inside of it, there was a dog. When he noticed that he had no right hand, he didn't like him. The dog tried to make him like him. At the end of the movie, his arms were both broken so he ... wait, no. His arms or his legs didn't work, so that's why his mom got him for him. Mm-mm (negative). It was a happy ending, that's why. That the boy kept throwing the dog. The mother. A dog with no arms. Playing video games. A ball. They both have no arms. Yeah. Happy. Happy. Happy. Upset. Mad. Sad. Kind of sad. Angry because he wanted a dog with arms, not have no arms. Eh. Happy. Happy. Happy.
