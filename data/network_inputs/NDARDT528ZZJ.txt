Yes. So, the child, who seemed like a shut-in, is given a puppy by his mother. He shows distaste for it when he learns the puppy has a disability. But then the puppy starts to grow on him as he sees it try to go about its life. Finally, he decides to outside and play with it, and it turns out that he has a similar disability. No. I liked how they didn't reveal that the kid had a similar disability until the end. So, it didn't show why he showed distaste for it at first, but then it was revealed at the end. That was very clever. Plus, that dog is a meme waiting to happen, running around in the box. I think I disliked the way the kid was portrayed, being a little bit cruel towards the puppy at first. His mother. A puppy. Playing a video game. A ball. They have a similar disability. All right. Probably a little bit confused, but also happy to be out of the box. Probably excited to have a pet. Dubious about the would be. Probably confused as to why he was thrown on the ground. Disgusted that his mother would give him a pet that had a disability. A little bit sad for the puppy. Confused, but also determined to get its owner's attention. Resentful of the puppy. Resentful of the kid for kicking the puppy. Happy to be accepted. Glad that the puppy didn't judge him for what happened earlier. I mean I'm glad that the issue was resolved.
