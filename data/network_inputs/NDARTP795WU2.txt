No. Okay. So there was the kid. I think his name is Jason. And Jason was playing on his electronics. And then his mom brought home a puppy missing a leg. An then he tried to just focus on his game and not the puppy. And then the puppy won over that. And they both went outside. And then by that time it showed that both of them were missing a leg. The kid has to get out more often. That I saw a dog like that the other day. Mostly because the kid had like the same condition as the dog, but he treated him like he didn't. His mom. A puppy. Playing Call of Duty. A ball. They're both missing a leg. Excited. Excited. I just stared there. I didn't really feel anything. He was feeling excited until the boy put him on the floor. Upset. I really don't feel anything when I watch movies. Upset. Mad. Nothing. Happy. Happy. Nothing.
