You mean, Minions? Oh yeah. Wait, I actually just saw it today. I never saw it any other time. Like a summary, right? At first the boy got a dog that he at first thought he loved. Then in parts of the beginning, he started ignore him. That made the dog want to try and annoy him even more. Then he kind of realized that he wanted to play with his dog, and so he did. I kind of mentioned everything. That he actually played with the dog. He didn't want to play with the dog. His mom, I think. The dog. Play a video game. A ball. They both liked to play. Neither. Happy. Happy. Normal. Upset. Annoyed. A little bit , but a little bit more normal. Happy. Angry. Kind of upset. Happy. Happy. Normal.
