I saw it at the Child Mind Institute. But I didn't see that broken leg. How did he get a broken leg? Did he kick ... maybe he kicked the dog a lot. Because when you kick dogs a lot, it might be growing up and then you might get a broken leg. Okay. With the minions? Try to tell the whole story. Then what happened? Then what happened? Yeah. And then the boy, and then the dog was going next to him and then the boy kicked him. And then he did it again, then he kicked him. And then he was like this ... And then they became friends. No, just that. I only like the minion movie. And it was super funny when the one start dance with the robots. I like it when they become friends. I didn't like when he kicked the dog. The mom. The dog. Playing video games. The ball. They're both playing. The boy. Are we going to watch in the computer? Happy. I mean great, I mean excited. Embarrassed. He was like ... oh wait, he was happy. I feeled a little bit sad because they became mad and then they were friends. I feeled kind of bored. He drops the dog. Sad and excited. Mad. Kind of sad. Okay. And then he did ... and then the dog did this and then the boy did something. He hurt him and then he said, "Get lost!" Sad. Angry. Sad. How did he break his leg? Hey, and then they grew, and then they played catch in their back yard. Super happy. Super happy too. Super happy.
