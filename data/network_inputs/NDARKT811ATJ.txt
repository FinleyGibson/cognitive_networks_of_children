No. A kid was playing a video game and mom came home late and he was just playing video games. And then the mother said, "Why don't you quit playing video games and open my gift?" And he just opened the gift and then there was a dog in there and it jumped out and it wanted to play. That's all I know. No. When the mother gave the gift. When the guy was just playing video games and not opening the box. The mother. A dog. He was playing video games. A ball. I don't know. What do you mean? No. What? Okay. Great. Good. I felt like they were happy together. Sad. Mad. Sad. Sad. Mad. Sad. Okay. Happy. Happy too. Happy too. The dog. Yeah.
