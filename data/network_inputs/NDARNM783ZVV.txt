No. So, the boy didn't ... Was playing video games when his mom came home. And, she brought a present for him. And, he opened the present and it was a puppy with only three legs. And, he didn't want him. So he  him on the floor and kicked him around. And, then the puppy found the ball. And then went out to play because the boy was also missing a leg. So they became friends. His mom went upstairs on a call. I don't know. I liked the entire thing. No. The mom. The puppy with three legs. Playing video games. The ball. They both wanted to play. Both of them. Okay. That was a really, really, really short movie. Happy that someone loved him. But, as soon as the boy saw that he only had three legs, he was like, "No, I don't want this puppy." But, he actually liked the puppy. He just didn't like that he had three legs. Happy that he had a puppy. I don't know. I didn't really feel anything. All I felt was that I had a headache and that I'm exhausted. Okay. Sad. Unhappy because the puppy only had three legs. Again, I don't feel anything. Just really tired. Left out. Burned out so unhappy that the puppy only had three legs. Again, nothing. Okay. I think they both felt so happy. Happy. Happy. Nothing. Besides exhaustion.
