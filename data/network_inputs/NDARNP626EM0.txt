No. I've only seen the captain before. Well, a boy was playing a video game when his mom came home and gave him a present. He thought it was something he liked. But when he opened it, it was a dog with one foot off. Then the dog found a ball and wanted to play catch with the boy. Then the boy kicked the boy and kept playing video games while the dog was trying to get it. It kept moving around. Then the boy got up and went outside to play with him. I do remember the boy having only one leg, and with the dog without a leg. Well, that there are minions and they had a rocket ship. Okay. What I liked about it was that the boy's leg was off, and the dog foot was off. The way the boy was treating the dog badly. His mom. A dog. Playing a video game. A ball. They both like the play. Both of them. Oops. Happy. Amazed. A little happy. Sad. Angry. Sad. Wanting to play. Angry. Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy.
