Wait, the puppy movie? I actually hadn't seen it. The beginning was like a kid playing like a video game. I couldn't really see it, but I think that is what it was and then I think his mom got him a dog, and then at first he didn't really pay attention to the dog. He didn't really interact with it or anything, but then after a little bit he went outside and played with it. Not really. Like the sort of the detail they put into the background. Like they didn't leave blank space, they had something in the background. I didn't like how the kid didn't pay attention to the dog, I guess. His mom, I think. I think, I don't know. I think that was the dog or, yeah. Playing video games. The ball. They both were playing with something. Happy. Happy? Like curious, what is going to happen next. Upset. Mad. A little bit upset because he just threw the puppy. Upset. Like maybe mad. I was upset. Happy. Happy. Happy.
