No, I have not. There was a kid playing a video game. His Mother came home and was like, "Hey, I brought you a present". He's like, "I don't care. I want to play my video game". And then he opened it, and it was a puppy. He was like, "Cool, a puppy". And then he realized the puppy was missing a leg and he was like "I do not want this broken dog" so he threw the puppy on the ground and kept playing his video game.                     But the puppy was very energetic and started running around and the kid took no interest in this poor pup. And  like swatting him out of the way. Eventually the puppy found a ball and brought him the ball and started playing with the ball. 
 Not really. I liked the plot twist at the end. I liked the character development you could say within the few minutes the movie went on. I mean, I didn't dis ... There wasn't anything that I specifically disliked about it. I didn't not like it. His Mother did. A puppy. Playing a video game. A red ball. They're both missing a leg. Both. He seemed very happy to have an alleged new friend. He also seemed very excited about getting a puppy. I was like, "Yay puppy!" And I like dogs, so ... Sad! He was thrown on the ground! I don't know, like a brat. I don't ... he was angry because his puppy was missing a leg. I was angry. He was a good ... that puppy did nothing! He did nothing. I mean in the beginning he got right back up but then the boy kicked him to the side. And he probably was not very happy about that. Annoyed that he now had this broken pup in his life that he did not ask for. I just continually felt bad for the puppy. He did nothing wrong. Seemed very happy. That's a very energetic puppy when they were going outside. I mean he was beginning to warm up to the dog so that's nice. I mean I was glad it was working out. That he could appreciate this innocent puppy.
