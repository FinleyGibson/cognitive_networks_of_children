Then she gave him this box, and then there was a puppy inside. Then they went outside, and then they played. One thing ... I feel bad for that boy because he lost his leg, and I was lucky that I wasn't like him. There was nothing that I liked in the movie. I don't know. I don't know. His mom. The puppy. Playing video games. A red ball. I don't know. I don't know. No. Okay. Happy. Happy. I felt ... I don't know. I didn't feel anything. I didn't have any emotion. Why is he mad? He was sad because  he felt good or bad, that he felt bad and that he didn't want him. Upset. I feel bad for the puppy because I don't ... When I get a dog, I'm not going to . I'm not going to have him growl. He was feeling normal, because he just wanted someone to adopt him, I think. Upset again. I feel bad for the puppy again. Excited. Happy. I feel happy, too.
