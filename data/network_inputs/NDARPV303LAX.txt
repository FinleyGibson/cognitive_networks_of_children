No. So, his mother came in and had a box and gave it to him. He was still playing his video game. But then he opened the box, and there was a puppy, and he was like, "Cool." And then he saw the puppy had his arm cut off here. So then he's like, "Ah, disgusting," and he threw him aside. I felt really sad that the puppy was ... like if you have a puppy that is disabled and has like three legs and one arm. No, two legs and one arm, that's sad. You should care for the dog and be nice to the dog. Yeah, so at the end he looked at the dog who was playing with the ball, and then the puppy gave it to him. So then he got the ball and he put it in his pocket. And it appears that he, the boy, didn't have like one leg. So then he played with the dog and was caring to the dog, and he said to his mom, "We'll be outside." The things that I liked about the movie was that I liked that the mom gave him a present, and he cared for the dog at the end. I didn't like that he was still playing his video game when the mom gave him his present, and he threw the dog aside and judged him by how he looked. The mother. The puppy. He was playing his video game. The ball. They liked to play. The boy is missing a leg. Okay. He was feeling excited. Feeling excited also. I felt excited. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Good. Good. Good.
