Yes. Was it the first one or the ... this one? The last one. No, I hadn't seen that one, actually. A boy was at home, playing a video game, and looks like his mom came home and got him a puppy, and at first, it seemed like he wasn't paying that much attention to it. And the dog kept wanting to play with him. Eventually, the dog came up to him, and then, they both went outside to play fetch with a ball. No, not much. I found it a bit enjoyable. It had a nice story to it. Not much, really. I didn't really see anything I didn't like. His mom. A puppy. Playing a video game. A red ball. Oh, they both were missing one leg. Both. Happy. Excited. Interested. He still looked happy then. Upset. Sorry for the dog. I don't know. It was not good at that point. Not happy about the dog. Still sorry for the dog. Excited, happy again. Better about having that dog. Much happier for both of them.
