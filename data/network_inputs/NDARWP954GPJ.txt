He kicked the dog and then he was playing fetch and then they ran outside to play fetch. He told his mom that they're going outside. He opened the box and he like saw a black stuff in there. I like when he played fetch. When he kicked the dog. The mom. A dog. Playing video games. What? A ball. They're not 'cause they're missing legs. Happy. Happy. Good. They don't have legs. The dogs keep falling. Happy. Excited. Mean. Fine. Sad because he's not playing fetch. Mean, mad. Good. They're missing legs. Happy. Happy. Happy.
