Yes. Okay. The mom, there was a boy on the couch playing Xbox, or any other game system it was. The mom walked through the door with a box. She placed it in front of the boy. She was on the phone, I believe, and walked upstairs or in to the kitchen. The boy put the game on pause and placed the controller aside him. He opened the box just a little bit and the dog popped out in excitement. The boy was happy, too, but when he lifted up the dog, he realized that the dog had an amputated left arm. He didn't really like it. I don't know why. He tossed him to the floor and he continued to play the game.                     The guys scootched up by leg, and he kicked the dog aside. The dog was on his back, and he saw the ball underneath the ... whatever, the desk, or whatever. It was a red ball, and the dog went to retrieve the dumb ball, and he got the ball. The boy looked at the dog while he was going underneath the table. Then, he looked back up at the game. The ball hit the boy, and the dog did a face. I think the boy kicked it into the box, and the dog went to go get the ball. He was limping a little bit, and tumbling, and falling. He ran into the box, and the box flipped over him. The boy looked up over the game and looked at the box to make sure the dog was okay or whatever. The box, the dog was trying to get out the box, so he started moving around a lot. The boy shook his head. He was like, "I don't care about this," and looked back to the game. 
 From this story? The story was sad, but fun at the same time because both of them have a common trait of not ... probably being picked on, from the dog being a dog, like inside of the adoption clinic. He was probably being picked on by other pups. The boy is probably picked on at school, so they share a similar experiences in life from losing limbs. That he started to care for the dog. He started to care for the dog because he felt bad because it was just the same as him. But I can say the dog was little more stable than him because he has three other legs, but still weren't being  and stuff. I can say, probably like at the end of the movie, they became really good friends and stuff. That he didn't appreciate the dog when he first saw the amputated leg, arm. The mother. The box was a brownish- Oh, what was in the box? A dog. Playing video games. A red ball. They have one lost, amputated limb on the left side of their body. Oh, that's actually like ... The boy. All right. That's fine. I know dogs can stand on their front legs. Puppy was feeling excited to be, to have an owner that thought, cared for him, and would play with him, and help him grow, and they would be together forever. The boy was feeling real happy at first. He was like, "Oh, this is great. Like better than a video game," but he turned the dog a little bit to the side and he saw that it had an amputated leg or arm and threw him to the floor. When I watched that part, when he threw the dog to the floor, I didn't really feel good about it because it's another system in this world. You have to take care of it, and give it care, and love, and affection just as you would expect your parents to give you. You have to treat care of the animal. When the puppy was in midair going towards the floor, I think he didn't really know what was happening, but he felt a little unappreciated. That's it. Disgusted. Unbelieved. Confused. Aggravated. Angry. The puppy was feeling better than before. I can definitely tell that. The boy was feeling a lot happier to have someone, a companion that shares similar emotions to him. Happy.
