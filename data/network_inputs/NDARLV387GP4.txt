Are you still looking at my brain? The last movie? That's a movie? No, Beginning I guess he lost his leg or he didn't grow with one. And, the end, I don't know. I've never watched this. That he got a dog. And, the dog has not a full leg like him. I don't really know. That the dog has no leg and it's weird. His mom. A puppy. Before he was given ... playing video games. A red ball. They both have a, you know, that, not full leg. Again? Frozen. Maybe we could just do the other questions? Again. Happy. Excited. Excited. Confused. Sad. Angry. I don't know. Still a little, you know, kind of ... I don't know the word that's going to go with it. Feeling ... I don't know. Confused. Happy. Happy. Still confused.
