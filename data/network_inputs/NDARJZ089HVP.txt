No. The boy is playing a video game and he really wants to ignore what his mother is saying. When he hears his mother, when she's walking up the stairs saying something about a present, he opens the box and finds a puppy with one of its legs missing.                     At first, he's just like really annoyed because it's just going up to him again and again, just wanting to play a lot. When he's getting to realize how nice it would be to have a puppy, he gets up and throws the ball. And then I realized he was able to connect with the puppy a little because he was missing one of his legs and the boy was missing one of his legs and the puppy was missing one of its legs. He was able to feel a little how the puppy felt. In the end he started playing with the dog and he started to like the dog a lot better.
 I liked how the boy's able to connect with what he's doing. I don't know. His mother. A puppy without a leg. He was just playing video games. He was playing with a ball. They are both missing a leg. Okay. It was probably feeling nervous to meet someone new but very excited. To play a lot with that person. He felt very excited. I was feeling very happy. It was probably feeling like annoyed 'cause he got thrown and when he was thrown he falls over. He was feeling very annoyed because the puppy didn't have a leg and he thought it was kind of disgusting. I felt a little sad for the puppy. It was feeling even more annoyed 'cause it was like saying, "Come and play with me" and the boy was like, "Stop, go away, you're bothering me" He was feeling very annoyed and he didn't want to bothered by the puppy. I felt bad for the puppy 'cause it getting thrown around and the boy just getting mad at the puppy was just kind of ... I didn't like to watch it. Okay. The puppy was feeling all happy and excited that the boy was playing with him. The puppy was also excited because it wanted to play with him. He was feeling very happy and all excited to play with the puppy. I felt very touched.
