It was in the style of the Pixar animated shorts. I was expecting some sort of twist at the end. It obviously provided. No. Well, it starts off with the kid playing video games. His mom walks in. She's like, "Oh, you're playing too much video games." She opens the curtain. The kid's like, "Oh, whatever." Then she walks in with a box and she puts it down. The kid's still playing, tryin' to do his thing. Before the mom goes upstairs to take a call, she's like, "Oh, you should check the present I got you." And then he's like, "Oh, it's for me?" He opens it and there's a dog with the one leg, I believe, on his left side, was missing. He was like, "Oh", and reacts for a second, but then he goes back.                     He's tryin' to just be a teenager, tryin' to be  like, "Oh, whatever. I don't care about the dog." The dog's doing cute stuff. He sees the red ball under the dresser and he gets it. He pushes it at him. The whole thing is the kid rejecting the dog repeatedly until he gives in and he goes. Then at the end he gets his crutches and the kid's missing his left leg and he goes out to play with the dog.
 Not really. I noticed the kid was playing a bootleg Xbox, I guess. I've just always been a fan of the shorts in general. They provide a whole plot to a story without being too long or too lengthy or whatever. Most of them are feel-good. That was sort of a feel-good movie. I didn't like the kid at first, but then I was like, oh, well, I see why he was acting the way he was when he saw the dog. His mom. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. They were both missing an appendage. Well, the boy is missing the leg and the puppy is missing his paw technically. I'm not sure if you could consider a paw to be an animal's hand or just a fourth leg, if you wanna  all weird and philosophical. Excited. Interested, I guess. It was cute. Betrayed. Or upset, I guess. Vulnerable and sad. Just 'cause I think that the dog reminded him of himself. I was a little ... I dunno, bugged, I guess. I think the puppy's just feeling like he's playing with him at that point. Bothered, annoyed. About the same. Content. I don't know what the word is for looking towards the future, or whatever, with the dog. Expecting, I guess. Felt better. Like the boy redeemed himself, so to speak. Or, not really redeemed himself, I guess it's just, understood why the boy could've felt the way he did.
