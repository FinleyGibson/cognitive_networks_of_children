Yes. Not sure. I don't have a good memory. Yeah I'm not sure. Um. When the girls had to leave. Yep. Actually no. There was a kid, mom and a dog in a box. The mom came home with a little surprise. The kid was playing video games and then he opened the box and he found that it was a puppy. Then he saw that the puppy didn't really have his paw and then through him on the floor and it wasn't being nice. Then the dog he found the ball and he wanted him to play with him but he threw it and he pushed it with his head next to his foot and he kicked it away. The dog was like a puppy so he didn't know. He thought he was playing. Then the ball it went in a box and the dog went in the box and he was having trouble running to it. He was having trouble getting out of the box because of his paw. He tried to get out a couple times and he couldn't then he tried harder and he got out. Then the next try he did they went out and they played catch. No. That there was a puppy. How the puppy didn't really have a paw and that kid didn't really have a leg. His mom. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. They both kind of didn't leg. Yep. Happy. Happy. Well excited. I felt happy. Sad. Grossed out. Sad. Sad and mad. Like weird. Really sad. Excited and happy. Happy. Happy and excited.
