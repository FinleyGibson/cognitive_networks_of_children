No. In the beginning, a boy was playing video games, but then his mother walked in with a bunch of stuff, and a package made of cardboard. Then he was still playing video games, and then she had something for him, and she put the box in front of him, on the table. Then he opened it, and it was a dog. Then he carried it, then it was drooling, then he said, "Ew," and then he dropped it on the floor.                     Then when the dog rolled over, he saw a red ball and then he went over there and got the red ball, and came back to him with the red ball. Then the boy, he kicked the ball into the box and then the dog, he ran to the ball in the box, and then the box flipped over him, then he walked with the box on his head. Then he took the ball, and then he rolled over, but then he took the ball again, and went to him. The boy picked it up, and then went outside with him and then threw the ball. 
 That the boy was in something on his hands. That the dog, and because ... the dog, that's it. Because of the dog. That the boy ignored the dog. The mother. A dog. Playing video games. A red ball. They're both boys. The boy. Happy, and because I did. Like he was excited, too. Happy and excited. I don't know, maybe still happy? Grossed out. Angry. Still happy. Mad, because he wouldn't get off of his lap. I don't know. Happy. Happy. Happy.
