What last movie? Oh yeah, no. The last story? That he got a dog, but he didn't like the dog because he had one leg missing. But that's actually kind of creepy. It's really creepy. I don't know, I didn't watch the whole movie. No. Mm-hmm (affirmative). That the boy would try to pretend he was missing one leg to and he had some crunches. Crutches. So he can lead the dog out or no. He was trying to play with the dog. Could I do like the different movie? Or no? Oh, okay. Well, I love dogs. I love dogs. And it was all about a dog. Was it a puppy or dog? I love puppies and dogs. Of the one leg dog? It's so creepy, ew. Disgusts me. His mom. A dog ... a puppy. He was still playing the game. The ball. Because they do the same thing. The puppy, the puppy. Why did you just ask me that question? That's so scary. Mm-hmm (affirmative) Oh, both, both! Okay. So he was stop the game and then he stopped the puppy. But he noticed he was missing a leg. He was feeling excited. I can tell. He was feeling ... well when he saw his leg he felt disgust. What part? It was freaky. Freaky! I did not see the one dog leg. Because the dog had a missing leg. Why was his leg missing? Mm-hmm (affirmative), yes, I saw it. Why was he missing a leg? Did he got ... his leg got cut off? He was feeling bad. Because the boy kicked the puppy. Angry. Mm-hmm (affirmative) Because I saw his mad face. Well, I don't like when someone kick ... well, I don't want someone kicking a puppy. So, I felt bad watching this part because no one kicks puppies. Their cute. Wait, we're watching another clip of the movie? And look, so now he's ... He was feeling happy, but he was kind of rolling around. He didn't know what was going on, so I think he felt a little dumb. Well, when he saw the puppy, he got the box, he was smiling in sort of way. But, he was more focusing on the game. I felt good. Oh another clip? Seriously? Ah, look! Look at him. Did he miss a leg? Did he like push his leg up the sleeve? He didn't push his leg up the sleeve? Where is it then? How you think the puppies feeling? He was feeling good, he was feeling happy. He was feeling excited. That's it? I was feeling good because the puppy and the boy was like getting along. That's it? Thank you.
