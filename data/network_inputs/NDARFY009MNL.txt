No. This person, he was on the stage and all the, I don't know what they're called, they were like screaming and jumping. He opened up a box and it was a dog and then the dog was like running around and like barking and he saw this red ball and he was playing with the red ball and the boy said like, "I lost the video game." Because I don't think he liked the dog. I don't remember. Like the girl stepped in a puddle and another girl said like, "Why are you doing this, don't go in the puddle." And they went to like this place and the person said, "You cannot make any sounds, you cannot scream, you can't laugh, giggle." And then he said, "You can't touch anything" and the baby or whoever it was he went and stook his face into the candy, like a candy plate. Yeah. That he opened up the box and there was just like a dog in the box. I liked all of it. Like that man, I don't know his name but. The dog. Playing like a video game. A ball. I don't know. Happy? Surprised that the dog was in there, he just like found it, he just opened it. Happy. Happy. Like upset that like the boy was just playing a video game and the dog wanted to do something with him. Upset that he needed to get out of the video game. I don't know. Sad. Angry that he like messed up his game. Like if it had happened to me that would be really annoying. Happy that he went outside. Happy. Good.
