Actually, yeah. There's a YouTube channel that I watched and it's all ... There were two movies that I've seen that were sort of like that. They were student films, and it was like, "Oh my god, a student made this!" The other one was, "Amazing movie, student made this." And it was like Disney is going to give a job to this kid or something. Okay. And ending, yeah. It was a boy. I imagine ... I'm not sure, but it looks kind of like they moved to a new house, but I don't really know. It was a boy. He played video games, and his mom came home with a box, and the box has a dog in it, but the kid didn't know that yet. So he was opening the box, and then he saw there was a dog in it. Do you have a tissue? There's probably one in my mom's bag. Yup. Okay. When I blow my nose, it gets really loud, so you might want to pause it. Okay. So- Yeah, I do. The boy and the dog, they both are missing a leg. And the kid realize ... The kid is playing a video game, and he gets the box, right? And he opens the box. He sees the dog. And he sees that the dog doesn't have his first leg, one of his legs. And then he thinks it's a joke, because he is missing one of his legs. Then he throws the dog on the ground, because he doesn't like it. And then he keeps ... It's playing around, and it finds a ball. And he keeps playing with that ball. The boy I guess feels guilty, and he thinks the dog's cute. And then they end up going out to play. I liked the song at the end. I really did like the movie. I don't think there's a lot that I didn't. His mom. A dog missing a leg. Playing video games. A red ball. They both were missing a leg. Okay. Happy. I believed he was happy and surprised, but then when he realized that dog's missing a leg, he was very mad. When I watched it, I was confused, because you couldn't see the boy was missing a leg. The first time I watched it. Now I know that. At that point? Probably a little confused. Also a little sad. It was a pretty happy dog. Mad, like I already said. Still pretty interested. I mean, still probably sad, but also a little happy. Because as soon as he got up, you know, he was there. Mad. I don't know. I can't really remember. The first time I watched it, it was about a month ago. And then that ... They were both very happy, I think. Very happy. Happy.
