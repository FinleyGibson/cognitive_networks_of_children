No. All right. In the beginning, this kid is playing a video game. Then his mom walks in and drops a box on the table, and he's still playing his video game, so he doesn't really realize it. Then his mom tells him it's there and then tells him to open it. So he puts down his controller and opens it and finds a dog. Yeah. And then, in the middle, he finds out that, he sees that the dog has one leg, and he doesn't want the dog because of that. He thinks it's like bad because it has only three legs. And then towards the end, he realizes the dog's just like him, because he has one leg that works, 'cause he doesn't have the other one. It showed how alike animals and humans could be. I did not like how the mystery of the dog. The mom. The dog. Playing a video game. A ball. They both don't have, they both lost a limb. Both. Excited. Excited. Happy, I guess. Still excited. Angry. Angry. Still kind of excited. Disappointed and angry. Angry. Happy. Happy. Happy. Both.
