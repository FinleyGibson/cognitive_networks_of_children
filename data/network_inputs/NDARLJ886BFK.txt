No. First there was a boy who was playing a video game, and then his mom came, and she had a box. He was playing the video game about for a few more seconds, and then he stopped, and then he wanted to see what was in the box. He opened it and it was puppy that was missing one leg. He was like, "Oh, ew." So, he threw the puppy on the floor, and the puppy saw a red ball, and ran to get the red ball, and he gave it to the boy. He threw the ball it went into the box, and then the puppy got it, but the box on the puppy in the ball slipped out. Then the boy ... Then the puppy tried to get the box off, and the boy took the ball, and he told his mom and said, "Mom, I'm going outside." And he was going to play with the puppy, and he had crutches. I liked in the ending that he wanted to play with the puppy. I didn't like when he was just playing the video game just staring tat the screen, and just threw the puppy on the floor. His mom. In the box was a puppy. He was playing a game. The puppy was playing with a ball. They're the same because they both ... Their legs, they both have one leg missing. Happy. Happy. I felt happy. Sad. Disgust. Sad. Really quite sad. A little bit bad. Mad. Loved. Loved. Happy.
