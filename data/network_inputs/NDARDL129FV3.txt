? No, I never saw that one. So in the video I seen, the boy was playing Call of Duty and then his mom came and she bought him a dog and he was being mean to the dog. And then that's when he realized the dog had three legs and that's when he picked up the ball. And then when he walked outside, he only had one leg technically like the dog. The dog kept falling when he was trying to walk. When the dog kept getting back up. When he kicked the dog. His mother. The dog. Playing the game. The red ball. They both have a missing body part. Both. Happy that he met somebody like him. He was happy. I was confused. A little sad. Angry. Why would he throw the dog? Like "why'd he hit me?" He was still angry. "Why would you hit the dog? He felt better because he realized the boy had a missing leg like him. The boy felt the same as how the puppy felt. I was surprised that the boy had one leg.
