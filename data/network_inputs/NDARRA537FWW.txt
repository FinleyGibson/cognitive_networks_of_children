He opened it and then the dog popped out, he was holding it and then he looked at the dog, and the dog didn’t have paw. And then he threw the dog on the floor, and then the dog rolled over and saw a ball. And then the dog picked the ball up and was putting by the boy. He kicked the dog. And then the ball in the box, and then the dog went in the box and it flipped over. And then box was moving. And then the dog had it in his mouth, the ball, and then he stand up and he had them crunches. His leg was missing. And then they went outside and played ball. No. The mom bought him a dog. When he kicked the dog. The mom. A dog. Playing games. A ball. They both lost their leg. The boy, like half of his leg. His paw. Okay. Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy. And then the boy threw him on the floor. Mad. Sad. Like a little bit sad. Mad. Like sad a little bit. Happy. Happy. Happy. The boy.
