No. It starts with a boy sitting on the couch just playing video games, when his mom comes with a box. She's, like, telling him to stop playing video games. Then she goes upstairs. While he's playing video games, he opens the box. He realizes there's a dog missing a leg. First he doesn't really know what it is, and he can't really walk, 'cause he's also missing a leg. First he just doesn't like the dog, 'cause it's just distracting him and his video game. Then he realizes ... He starts kicking the ball, but then the dog brings it back. When the dog brings it back, it gives him an idea, like to stop playing video games and play outside with him. So, he opens the door, brings the dog out, and plays fetch. There were a lot of bleeping sounds ... be bo bo bo bo bo. The movie. Also, it's weird how he, usually, just tries to kick the dog away, 'cause I like dogs. It's very ... It gives you an idea what to do when you're bored. Instead of playing video games, get up and be active. Like the boy being mad at the dog, kicking him around, kicking the ball away, being all mad about everything. His mom. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. Well, they both are missing a leg, but they both want to do something. Both. Okay. Happy, 'cause he finally has someone to play with. Also, happy, 'cause he also has someone to play with. Very happy. Very sad, 'cause the person he wants to play with threw him. Probably mad, 'cause he's ... I think he thinks the dog is stinky. Sad. Very sad. Distracted or annoyed. Well, I really didn't want it to happen. I mean, I just wished that the boy would just listen to the dog that time and just play with him. At least, pause the video game. Okay. Very happy, 'cause he finally gets to play with him when he's trying to ask him all day. Also, happy, 'cause he realizes that playing with the puppy may be more fun than just sitting on the couch playing video games all day. Happy.
