Yes. No. First, the boy was playing a game, and then, a puppy, and then the mom came, and then he paused his game, and then a puppy game out. And then, he was just laughing. And then, he didn't have another hand. And then, he was going out to throw the ball, but the other boy didn't had a leg. They went outside to play fetch. The period. No. I don't know. One, when they was playing fetch. When he was not gonna play with him. What, mom. A dog. Huh? Playing. A game. Only a ball. Because they didn't have the arm. Both of them. Okay. Happy. Happy too. Happy. Hurt. Like ... Mad. Oh, it has the same Xbox as me. Yeah. Annoyed. Annoyed. Mad, super mad. That's what he said? Hello, can you hear me, but I wanna watch him. Happy. And the boy was happy. And I was happy.
