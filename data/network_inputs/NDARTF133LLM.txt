Yes. So, there was this boy that lost his leg, then his mom came home with a surprise and then she left the surprise on the table. She said it was for him. He stopped playing video games, he opened the box, it was a dog. The dog had a broken leg too. He didn't like it so, he just threw him off the table. Then, the dog saw this red ball. He started taking it and started giving it to him but the boy didn't want to play with him so he threw it and the dog got it. Then, he lost it, then the guy laughed, the boy laughed but he tried to not to, so then, he actually liked the dog, so he took the ball and the dog and him went outside. One thing I liked about that movie was that the boy didn't want to like the dog but didn't want him to know that he didn't like the dog. That I did not like about that movie that the boy was being mean. The mom. A dog. He was playing video games. The ball. They both have two broke...one broken leg. Happy. Sad. Well happy. Happy. Sad. Mad. Normal. He was feeling hurt and the boy was feeling mad. Normal. He was feeling happy. Happy. Happy.
