No. . Don't know. No. . I liked the puppy. He was cute. The boy was being mean to the puppy. His mother. The puppy! Opening it and sneaking opening it. The other red ball. I don't know. The boy. The boy. I don't know. Mad. At first, he was happy and then he got a little bit mad. Tired. Hurt feelings. I think his feelings were hurt because the boy threw him on the ground. Mad. Still tired. Hurt. His feelings were hurt. Mad. Still tired. The boy was losing. The boy was losing. I knew it. I knew the boy was losing a leg. Now he was feeling still feeling hurt. But he had been running outside because he wanted the ball. Still mad. Still tired.
