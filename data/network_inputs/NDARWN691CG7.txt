No. First, there was this kid who was playing video games and his mom said he left a puzzle, I think. He opened the box and he finds a dog. First, he likes it, but then he sees it has a missing leg. Then he throws the dog on the floor. Then the dog sees the red ball and gets it. Then the kid kicks the dog and the dog thinks he's just playing around. Then the dog tries to get the ball again because it got out of his mouth, and the dog kept on tripping. He went inside the box and the kid laughed because he ... Because then when he got up, I saw that he had a missing leg too. Then they went outside and played. His mom went on the phone with somebody. That I liked at the end, he cared about the dog. That his mom didn't really pay attention. He just dropped the box and just went upstairs. His mom. A dog. Playing a game. The ball. They both had missing legs. Both. Happy that he had a owner. I think he felt surprised. Happy. A little sad. Mad. A little angry. Annoyed. Still mad. Sad. Happy. Happy. Happy.
