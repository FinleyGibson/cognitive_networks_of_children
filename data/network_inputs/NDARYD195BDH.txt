I didn't see that movie. So the dog went outside with the boy. So the beginning it was like a box and a dog was in there, and then the dog got out, and the brother was playing video games, and then the dog was trying to get the thing that he was playing for the video games. And then he wanted to go outside, so they went outside. It's a short story. Can I talk about the other movie? The dog  at the boy. I liked about the dog and the boy walking outside. I didn't like that the dog bit the thing for the boy's video game. His mom. The dog. He was playing video games. He was walking around. He was playing with the boy's video game thing. Because they both have brown hair. Yeah. Oh! And after the puppy was in the box, the boy holds the puppy. He was happy. Angry at the dog, getting his video game cord. Good! Sad when the boy threw him on the ground. Mad. I was just watching it. I was thinking about Pokemon Yeah. Happy. And when he jumped up, and then the boy put him on the floor. Mad. Happy! He wanted to go outside, and the boy said, "Mom, we're gonna go outside!" And the boy threw a ball to the dog, and then they walked. Happy. Happy. Happy. Yeah.
