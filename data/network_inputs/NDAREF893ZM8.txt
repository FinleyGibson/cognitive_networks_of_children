Mm-hmm (affirmative). I have. Okay. So what happened was ... there was this criminal. His name's Gru and he wanted to be... Oh. So what happened was there was this boy and he was like, playing video games and he, like, didn't want to go outside. Then he found ... and then he like, his mom got him for a present ... he got a dog that only had three legs and then, at first he wasn't interested in the dog, and then eventually he got up and I realized that he only had one leg. So then he went outside and then he started playing with the dog. That's really it. Well, it's probably like, a lot of kids have actually had that happen to them, where like, they're playing video games all the time and they go outside and then eventually they get a pet and then they finally go outside. Well, I didn't like that it was short. I wish that it was longer. That's really it. His mom. A three-legged dog. Playing a violent video game. A ball. A red ball. They are, they both are missing one leg. And yeah. The puppy is probably happy to see the kid. At first interested, but then not really. I felt happy. Sad. Angry. Kind of disgusted. Like sad, and like rejected. Angry. Once again, like disgusted. Probably happy. Happy as well. Happy. Yeah.
