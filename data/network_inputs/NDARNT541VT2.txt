Yeah I have. Okay. There was a boy who got a new dog but the dog didn't lost once of its legs or didn't have one of its legs. He kind of threw it aside, not accepting it. Then little by little he started growing affection to it and then it turns out he actually was missing a leg as well. It was like relatability. It was funny at some points, like with the dog slamming its head and thing. It was heartfelt, like I felt emotion the first time I saw it I felt emotion. It was relatable like the way the kid acted. I can't think of really anything else. I didn't like how he threw the dog, just because I didn't like it. The mom. The puppy. He was playing some sort of first person shooter. He was playing with a ball. They both are missing a leg. Both. Happy. Excited. Happy for the boy. Rejected. Disappointed. A little upset that he just threw the dog. Sad. He was still upset. Pity for the dog. Happy. Also happy. All the about happy. Both.
