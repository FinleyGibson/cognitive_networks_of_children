In the beginning, the mom, she got the box from wherever the puppy was in. He was missing a leg. The kid was missing a leg too, so basically it's like a sad movie 'cause people can lose legs 'cause his right leg. No, his left leg is gone. And, then the puppy's right leg is gone. He was just nudging the dog. He was like, "Oh, no. I don't want to play with this dog." And, then all of a sudden after like two minutes, they started to like each other more. And, then the kid basically took the dog out to play with the ball. Mm-mm. It was cool. Nothing. The mom. The puppy. Playing video games. The ball. 'Cause they both lost their legs ... Their leg. Both. Happy. Excited. Well, what do you mean by that? What do you mean by that? Excited. Sad. Angry. I loved the . Sad. Extremely mad. A little mad. Happy. Happy. Happy.
