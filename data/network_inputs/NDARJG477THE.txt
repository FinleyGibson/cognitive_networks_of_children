Never. First when the kid was playing the video game Call of Duty, the mom came back and bringed a box with a present and it was a puppy. And then he smiled and then he kicked the puppy. And then the puppy found the ball and then he pushed himself into the door and then he went under and get the ball. And then he put the ball next to the boy and the boy pushed him and the boy pushed the ball, kicked it in the box and the puppy when in there and the puppy was stuck. Then the puppy bringed back the ball to the boy and the boy they went outside and played ball. The mom went upstairs. I liked the part when he played with the puppy outside and threw the ball. When he kicked the dog. The mom. A puppy. He was playing video games? He was just in the box barking. The same? The puppy ... no they're not the same. It was smiling. Now I know the dog was barking and then they were both happy with a smile. Happy. Mad and happy. Sad. Sad when he throwed him on the floor. Mad. Sad. Sad. Mad. A little bit sad.                     This part I was happy. 
 Happy. Happy. Happy.
