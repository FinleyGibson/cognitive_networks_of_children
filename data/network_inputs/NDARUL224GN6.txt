No. Despicable me or the... The boy was mean to the dog so the boy had no leg and the dog was in the box. He saw he had like the dog so the dog jumped out and he held it and the main thing he did was he saw there was no leg so he like kicked it away and then it came back to him and he kicked it away again and then the dog saw a ball and he was like flipping and playing with it and then the boy chucked and then just made a mad face again and started playing the video game again but then the dog kept on trying to alert him to play with him and then the boy finally played with him and then they went outside and played with each other. No. That the boy and the dog played together. That the boy kicked the dog. The mom. The dog. Playing video games. A red ball. They both had no leg. Okay ... I don't want to see the part again where the boy kicked ...  Happy. Like disgusted out from the dog. Sad at first but happy at the ending ... I don't like that Still playful. Disgusted again. Sad that the boy kicked the dog. That was so sad. So rude. Still playful. Oh, I think he felt the boy was trying to play with him. So disgusted he didn't even want to play with him, the dog. Happy that the puppy was still like playful. The present. Is that a real movie? Happy, finally happy. Happy as well. So happy.
