The boy didn't like the dog at first, but then he did. The dog. When the dog was chasing after the ball. That's it. When the person kicked the dog off his lap. His mom. A dog. Playing a video game. What? A ball. They both can walk. Happy. Yeah. Happy. Happy. Sad. Angry. Because the dog licked him. Sad. Angry. Angry. Sad. Happy. Happy. Happy.
