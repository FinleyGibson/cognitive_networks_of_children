Not really. I've it most on YouTube but I didn't really watch the whole thing. What happened in the movie was that the kid, I do not know his name, his mom got him a dog who had the same disability as him, because the kid actually was born with no left leg ... I have no clue which side of the leg it was ... and the dog had one front leg. The kid, at first, just dropped the dog, didn't really want him. But then the dog started playing around with the ball and then the kid really wanted to play with him. At the end, they played catch. The dog. The way the kid treated the dog at first. The mom. The dog. Playing video games. The red ball. They have the same disability. Excited. Also excited, until he saw what the dog had.  Confused. Annoyed.  The puppy was feeling slightly confused and a little excited because he wanted to play with the owner but the kid didn't want to play with him. Annoyed.  Happy and excited. Happy.
