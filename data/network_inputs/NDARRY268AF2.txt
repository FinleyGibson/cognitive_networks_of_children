Yeah. In the movie, there was three girls, and there was- The dog? I saw the mom brought home a present for the little boy, and he was playing his video game, and he opened up the box, and then he found the dog, and then he said, "Scram," and then he pushed him away, but he found out that the dog had no leg. And then, he stopped playing ball with him in the house a little, and then he started getting into the thing. And then, when he got up, he had crutches, because he had no leg, and they went outside and played. When he screamed at his mom to get out of the way. It was really funny. It was sad that they didn't have any legs. The mom. A dog with no leg. He playing video games. The red ball. Cause they both have no legs. Both of them. Happy. Happy, too. Kinda sad, kinda happy, cause the dog had no leg. Just sad, because he just threw it on the floor, because he looked at his leg, because he thought that the dog had four legs, but he or she didn't have any legs. Mad, because the dog didn't have any leg. Sad. Sad, too, because the puppy was trying to play with him, and he said, "Get lost." Mad. Sad. Happy, because he went outside and played with the pup. Happy. Happy.
