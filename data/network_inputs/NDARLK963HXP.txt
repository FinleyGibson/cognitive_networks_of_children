At the beginning, the boy played a video game. Then, her mom came home and give ... and put a box in front of him. But, later he don't play. He just play, play. After a later, he just open the box, and there was a puppy. He pick it up, then the puppy don't have one half a front leg. That's why he just don't want to pick it again. And he just liked that puppy because when the puppy found the boy, then the puppy that to the boy. The boy throwing the box. Then, it was funny. He liked that it was funny ... he liked the dog. Then, the boy don't have also a leg, and the dog also don't have a leg. That at the end, they both friend each other. They make a friend each other. That when he just picked up the dog, and say, "you." I don't like that part because the puppy ... I like a good dog, good puppies. His mom. I think so. Puppy. Playing the video game. Huh? A boy. The puppy don't have a leg, and the boy also don't have a leg. Both of them. Good, happy. Because he saw a boy, and the puppies like boys. And the parents, they like kids, I think. Good and he feel good. After that he feel bad and a little sad. Good. But, a little I don't like that part because he just said you ... Sad, a little sad. Mad. Sad. Also, again, sad. Mad. Sad. Happy, too happy. Too happy. Happy.
