No. Okay, so basically the mom came home from work, the son ... I think it's the son, was playing video games and he was handicapped, like he didn't have his knee to down, like he didn't have none of that. He had crutches. Then the mom came home from work and gave him a box. What was inside the box was a puppy. Then the mom walked upstairs and was talking about work. Then he saw the box, he saw like the dog and then he dumped the box and the puppy came out. Then the puppy was barking like he wanted to play and then he just moved it over to the side and the puppy barked again. Then he moved it over to the side. Then it went upside down and seen the ball. Then he was barking and put the ball right next to the son, the kid. The kid threw it in the box and he went to go get it again and then the dog bite the ball and came back and dropped the ball.                     After that, the kid finally decided to play with him. Before he was going to play with him, he said, "Oh, I'm going outside." Then he played with the dog but, basically the memorial of the story is the perspective of the dog. 
 No, not really. The ... Despicable Me? Oh, okay. It just showed me the perspective of the dog. That's what I liked. How he kicked the dog to the side kind of, well, not kicked him. The mom. A dog. Playing video games. The ball. They're both handicapped. Both. Excited. Surprised. Well, I was thinking what would happen next. Like crap. Disappointed. Kinda like upset. Upset. Like he's tired of it, just get away, I'm playing my games. I don't like when he kicked the dog. Excited. Like he's doing something good. Happy.
