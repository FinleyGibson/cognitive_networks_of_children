Only on YouTube, I guess. I don't know. I watched it on YouTube. I forgot that he had that missing leg. Okay, so the boy, he was playing a video game. I think he was playing like a game, like he's in war and he's in a jet. He's trying to shoot other people in the other jets. So he was trying to play that ... This is the middle ... So the mom comes on, he brings them up that present. I forgot that was the one missing leg dog. So he didn't even like it. He looked on the missing paw. He didn't like it. He also said, "Scram" and "Get lost." That kid was very mean to his own dog. Then at the end, I didn't realize he had that one missing leg. I never looked at that part. I never looked at it. Well, I know the mom is talking to somebody, and I know she went upstairs, but there's one thing that was ... I think I saw the jet playing game, but he paused it because he didn't like it. He might crash, like go down and crash. So that's why he might have paused it. I don't know. But it was awesome. Now am I gonna watch Despicable Me? The dog. Yeah. That he was being mean to the dog. The mother. A dog. He'd been mean to the dog. He was playing some video games. The ball. Oh, they have the missing leg. Great. He was smiling. He looked like he was very playful. Very sad because he had the missing ... Missing leg. I felt sad about the boy and the dog with the missing leg and the other missing leg. A little sad ... A little sad. I really wanted to cry about that part. A little bad ... A bad person. He feels a little bad. Then when he gets happier because the dog, he wants to play outside. Like a little bad. I felt a little sad about the dog. This is not blood, but I don't know why that's there. It's probably from the Dorito. I eat Doritos a lot. A little sad because he got flipped over and he says, "Get lost." A little more bad. A little sad, again. A little more sad. Okay. Why are you like ... Why are you like ... When you showed me . A little happier. Like, really happy. And now I'm feeling so good on that one. Happy, not bad anymore. He's good this time. Happy. Like, extremely happy.
