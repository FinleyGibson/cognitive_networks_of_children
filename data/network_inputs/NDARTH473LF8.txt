No. Well, the kid was playing video games. Then when the mom came home, she brought a box for the kid. It was a present. When the kid opened it, there was a dog, but it only had three legs. Then he pushed away the dog, and the dog found a ball and kept on playing with it. Then the kid turned off the video game, and went outside with the dog. It turned out that he was missing a leg. No. That the kid finally made up with the dog, and started to like it. Nothing really, I like it. The mom. A dog. He was playing a video game. With a red ball. Because they're both missing something. Both. Excited. Excited too. I felt happy for the boy. I feel like, rejected. All mad that the mom had to do this to him. Sad. I think he was feeling rejected again. Sad, and mad that the mom had to give him a dog that only had three legs. I felt mad that boy wouldn't play with the dog. I think he started to feel excited then that the boy was playing with him. Happy that the dog is liking him, and he's playing with him. Happy for the boy and the dog.
