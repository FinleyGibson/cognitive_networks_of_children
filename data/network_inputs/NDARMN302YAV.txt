No, but it's like a boy who had never asked for a dog but then a dog came in with his leg broken. Now his leg is broken. Yeah but ... There's nothing I can say much. It's like we can figure out something in a movie but we never know what's gonna happen next. It's like ... It's a boy got a dog and the dog wants to play with the boy. His leg is broken so he was running. Then his leg was broken so he couldn't run so he was running, then he was flipping out all over the place. Then the boy's leg was broken. They were playing catch outside. No. Then ... Well, there's only one thing. Why does that boy have nobody? That's the only thing. There's not that much I could explain. No, cause it was so sad. Well, not to me. It wasn't sad. Everything. See, the reason is that I didn't like everything is because ... I don't know what to say but we like ... I just don't know ... Because we're like watching the movie instead of being in the movies and then we don't have to watch it again. Even though we know what happen in the movie and then we like ... We do all the playing and then we can remember that movie. Then we can just think about We can just watch the clip. Nobody. No. Dog. Playing a video game. A ball. Cause they were playing with ... Playing. The leg is the difference .... That they're not the same type. At first ... Stop the clip. Stop. Stop it. I can't tell. Both. Kay. So happy that he had an owner. Yeah. I my ear. Happy too. I didn't see nothing. I didn't see nothing. I didn't see the movie. I only see the part when his legs broke ... When their legs were broken. I felt nothing. So sad. Mad. Wait, easily? I don't know. I don't know. I don't feel no emotions yet. The last clip? Not too much happy because when you like ... It's like you don't ... Having something that you don't like and just get it and then you just start liking it. I think ... I don't got much to say about the boy. Nothing. The last one. You're not even looking at the clip. Can you see it? How? Like hugged. He felt happy. One question, when did you get that camera? I ain't got no more questions. I ain't got nothing to say. I ain't got nothing to say. Nothing to say. I didn't see the puppy. I didn't see the puppy but I only see the boy. Not when he turned around. I didn't see and play ... I didn't see them play. Just now. My head still feels goopy. I ain't got nothing to say.
