Yeah, I saw it on Twitter once, that little video. It's cute. This boy gets a present from his mom, and it's a dog. I was like, "Who puts a dog in a box like that and doesn't tell anybody who that is," but whatever. The dog is disabled like him. It's like a nice little thing, because at first, he doesn't like him, because you know, he's disabled, whatever, like doesn't have an arm. But then, I don't know. They get along at the end. It was cute. The dog is cute. I did not like ... Oh, well, he was rude at first. He was, you know, not accepting of the dog. I was like, "Oh my god. Why would you be mean to him just because of that?" You know? The mom. The dog. Playing video games. A little red ball. They both don't have a limb. Excited. Oh, he was excited, too, and then he realized that he didn't have a arm. Then he was like ... after, but that wasn't in the clip. Fine. Well, I don't think he was too affected, but I could tell that he was rude as fuck, you know? He was mad, I guess. I was annoyed, because I don't like people treating dogs like that and like ... Poor mom. He was sad that he kicked him. Oh, he was feeling mean. I don't know, like ... Happy. Same. Yeah. Good. He accepted him now and they're like the same. It's so cute.
