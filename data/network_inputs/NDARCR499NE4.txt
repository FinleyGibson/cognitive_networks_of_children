No The thing that happened in that story was the beginning was when the boy didn't want a dog and he said he didn't like a dog with no leg but he didn't have a leg so they had something in common. And then in the middle, he thought the dog was cute and then started going outside and then at the end he wanted some time to play with the dog so he told his mom that he'll do the other thing soon. I think that was it. I liked nothing about the movie. All of the things I did not like about the movie. I do not like the part when the dog and the boy have no leg and walking outside. I didn't like the part when they got the dog. I didn't like the part when he was playing the video game. I didn't like the part when it just started. I didn't like the part I didn't like the end. I didn't like before the beginning. The boy's mom. A dog. Distracted by the video game. The ball. Because they were both playing with something and they both had no hand or no leg. What? No. The puppy was feeling happy. He was feeling disgusted by it because it had no arm and then he said "Ew." Yeah. Um I felt disgusted by it too because I didn't like when the boy or the dog didn't have no leg because I think it looked disgusting. The puppy was feeling sad because the boy didn't want to play with him. Um he was feeling disgusted. Disgusted with what the boy was feeling. Really sad because he said to get lost and he didn't want to get lost. He was still feeling distracted. He was still distracted and disgusted. Still disgusted. The puppy was feeling happy. He was feeling happy. So disgusted. Yup.
