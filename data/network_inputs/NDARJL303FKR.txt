No. It starts off with a kid playing video games. When the mom comes home she brings a box and puts it right in front of him. The kid opens the box and there's a dog. He likes it at first. Then he sees the dog's missing a leg. Then he throws it on the floor and kicks it. Then the dog sees a ball, so he goes after the ball and then brings it to the kid and the kid kicks the ball in the way and the dog chases it. The kid ends up liking the dog. The kid got up to go outside and he was missing a leg too. No. That it was an inspiring movie. How the kid was just being mean to the dog at first. The mom. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. They were both missing a leg. Okay. Yeah. It was happy. He was happy. I was happy. He was feeling sad. Mad. I was mad that the kid just threw the dog. Sad. Mad. Same as last time. Happy. Happy. I was happy.
