And then he found the ball, trying to get it. He went in the box and he was banging and stuff and they went outside, played catch, fetch. No. Dogs. Kicking the dog. The mom. A puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They was both playing with each other. The puppy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Mad. Angry. Sad. Unhappy. Mad. Mad. Happy. Happy. Happy.
