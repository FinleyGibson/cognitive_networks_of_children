No, I haven't. In the beginning, the boy was playing video games, and his mom came in and brought a present and asked if he was going to open it. It brought in a box. He just kept playing his game, but eventually he did ... When he did decide to open the box there was dog in there, which was very unrealistic, but okay. He did not want the dog there while he was playing games, so he threw it onto the floor. It ran around a little bit and came back, and he kicked it away. But as it just ran around the house, playing with the ball and things like that, it took more and more of his attention until he put down his game and ... The dog was taking more and more of his attention, but he didn't want to pay attention to it. He almost didn't want to be interested, but he was, and so eventually they went outside and played with the ball.                     The boy was on crutches, which was probably part of the reason why he wasn't getting up, and just sitting there on the couch the whole time. One of my main takeaways was that it was a very unrealistic story, but it had a point and that's all right. 
 I remember when his mom came in, she went to the fridge, and I remember the boy wasn't on crutches because he had a broken leg, but he had no leg from the knee down. Just like some little details, not anything. The animation was good. It wasn't sloppy or something like that. It really looked like some animated films right now. It sort of felt like it was trying to just say play with your pets, don't play video games. Just like that's a sort of an absolute, like you should always play with your pets over playing video games at any given moment. While I agree that spending time with pets is important, and spending time with video games is not as important, it's not fair to say that you have to give up one or the other. His mother did after buying it herself. A puppy. He was playing video games on the television. A red ball that it found underneath a cupboard and that at one point it got stuck underneath the box. I don't know how  playing with it. They both wanted to keep doing what they were doing. The puppy wanted to keep playing with the ball, the boy wanted to keep playing his game. Okay. Very excited, but also probably nervous, like, "This is where I'm going to be. What's going to happen? I don't know. Oh look, a person. I like it." Excited, sort of like in suspense. I don't know if he really knew what to think at that very moment, but he was enjoying himself. Optimistic, like they're going to get along. A little bit surprised, but it looked kind of un-phased afterwards. It was just like, "Oh, well, that was a bit of a bump, but I don't think it means anything." He seemed disgusted or annoyed or even regretful. I was upset with the boy because, frankly, that clip made me feel like he was kind of a jerk. I feel like it's ... It wasn't my favorite part. Hurt. I can't really remember the word. Felt like ... I don't remember the word, but like something keeps happening over and over again and you're just tired of it. It was sort of more of the same, what happened last time. I wasn't really expecting it to keep happening over and over again, but again, I was sort of like, "Why? What reason is there for doing that?" It was really overjoyed that even after he had been throwing and kicking it away, they ended up going outside to play. Happy that he decided that the puppy would be his friend. I felt happy. Part of the reason was because the music, the music is usually meant to set a good mood, and  as well. I liked how they were ... I was happy that they were getting along and that he decided to go out and play with the puppy.
