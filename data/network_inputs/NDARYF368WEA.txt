We talkin' here? Alright. Yeah, I heard of it, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well it started with a boy playing video games, and his mother walked in at five minutes in. And then, she talked about oh why I've been playin' that game all day. And she said "Oh, I got a present for you." And then, he was still playing the video games. And then, he noticed a boxed that his mom gave him, and inside was puppy. And then, when he first saw the puppy he said "Get lost!" And then the puppy saw the ball. And then, he was like "Oh, he want's to play Fetch with him". But he still played video games until he begged him to play with him. And then ... But he was still ... He wasn't even listenin' to him much. And then, you know towards the end, he finally convinced him to play with him. So, yeah that's pretty much it. Um, not really much. I only really remembered ... The last few stuff I remember. Um, it's the animation. You know, it's pretty good. It's like a foreign film, right? Yeah, it's a foreign film, so like the animation quality's really good. And you know, just finally begged him to play with him. Is really ... Show a sense of character to him. That, you know. Yeah. Um, just he treated him at first. The puppy just was kinda like ... He was pretty much a jerk towards the puppy at first. But, you know, he had a change of heart later on. So, you know. Uh, his mom. A puppy. Playing video games. The ball. Um. Well, the characteristics are different but ... Um, I can't really describe it well. Yeah I don't know. The boy. Okay. Is it same questions or just different? Okay. Um, happy. A lil' happy, yeah. Um, surprised. He didn't know what to expect 'cause it a puppy. describe it. Yeah. Um, pretty happy inside. Who wouldn't like a puppy? You know. It's pretty happy to see it. Upset, because he peed on the boy. And he just threw him to the ground. A lil' pissed off. Upset that he peed on him, and then just laid him on the ground. Um, a lil' upset. Well, if I was him I would be upset too. Like, he peed on me I would just. You know. A lil' discouraged and scared that he wanted to play with him, but then the boy just told him to get lost and just, kicks him and stuff. So. A lil' annoyed that we didn't really wanna play with him. Mmm, upset and, you know, annoyed too. 'Cause he kicks him to the ground. Yeah. Oh, this part.  He felt joyful. And happy that he finally gets to play with him. 'Cause he been waiting for him for so long to play with him. The boy never gave him the chance to play with him. Um, well, he finally got the ... He finally admits that he wants to play with him. And, he doesn't wanna be a jerk to the puppy anymore. So just finally wants to play Catch with him. Happy. And excited, because he's finally playing with the dog.
