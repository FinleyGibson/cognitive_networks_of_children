The boy was playing games then his mom brought him a dog. He didn't like the dog because the dog only had one arm. Then he would play with the dog. That he played video games. That the dog had one arm. His mom. The dog. Playing video games. Fetch. The ball. Because they both had half body parts. Happy. Happy. I don't know. Sad. He thought the puppy was weird. I still don't know. Mad. Mad. It's weird that he had to walk with the cane. Happy. Happy. I don't know.
