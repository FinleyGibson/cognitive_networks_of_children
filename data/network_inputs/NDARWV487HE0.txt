No. I don't really remember.Cause, and then I start to close my eyes. And then I keep opening my eyes. I remember the end when the boys playing video games. And his mom brought home a dog that's like him. Cause the dog was missing a leg, and he was missing a leg. So, they both had disabilities. And then, at first he didn't want to play with the dog. He picked up the dog, then he just threw it down. He didn't want to play with the dog. But then, later on, I thought he was just going to let the dog run away, but he went outside, in the yard, in the front yard, to play with the dog. Not really. I liked how the dog was finding things to play with. When the boy threw down the dog. His mom. Well, the woman. The dog. Playing video games. A red ball that he found under the counter. Cause they were both disabled and they were missing a leg. Both of them Happy and excited. Happy and excited. I did .... In that part, how do you think the puppy was feeling? How do you think the boy is feeling? How did you feel when you watched this part? Here's another one. Sad. I think he's still upset. A little mad. Wanted again. Okay and Happy.
