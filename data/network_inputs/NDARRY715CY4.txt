No. The mother gave the boy a doggy, a puppy! And then the puppy wanted to play and the boy didn't want to play with the puppy. And then after that, the boy wanted to play with the puppy and then they went outside to play fetch. The puppy! Puppy. Puppy. Nothing! The mommy. A puppy! Playing video games. A ball. Because they both like to play with things. Happy! Happy. Dookie, dookie, happy. Sad. Mad. Sad! sad and mad! Sad. Mad. Sad and mad at the boy. Mad at the boy and sad at the puppy. Happy. Happy. Happy!
