No. A boy was playing a game and then his mom came and gave him a present. Then she got a phone call so she went upstairs. He opened the present and it was a dog. It was missing a leg. He wanted to play. Then he just knocked him away. He tried to play again and then he started to get warm to it. He started to, "You know what? I'll give him a chance and I'll start to play with him." Then he got on his crutches, or whatever those things are, and he walked outside. He was also missing a leg. He was mad at first. He actually gave him a chance at the end. That he pushed and shoved him off. His mother. A dog. He was playing a video game. A ball. They're both missing a leg. Happy. Happy also. Happy. Pushed away. Like he was getting mocked because he has a broken leg and the dog has one. I don't know. Angry, I'm guessing. Mad because he didn't like the way the dog looked. I was mad at the kid because he pushed him. Happy, I guess. More happy, I guess. Happy, also.
