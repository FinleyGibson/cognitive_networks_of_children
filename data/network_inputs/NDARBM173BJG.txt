Yes. At my school. In writing class. We were doing a response on it. In the beginning; the boy's mom brings in a present, which is the dog. At first, the boy wanted nothing to do with the dog since it only had three feet and it couldn't walk so well. But, then, when he saw how playful it was, he decided that he should give it a chance and it made him really happy when he finally got with it. He also had only one ... He had to use a cast to walk since he also was missing a foot. What I liked was that the boy actually found acceptance to the dog. Was when he neglected it, because it had the same symptoms as him. His mother. The puppy. Playing video games. The red ball. Then, he wanted his owner to play fetch with him. They both have missing a foot. Okay. Yes. He was feeling happy that he thinks it's a new friend. He was feeling happy when he got a puppy. It felt nice that they were starting to feel good about each other. He was feeling a bit mixed sad and happy but, then, he started to feel a little better when the red ball came. He was feeling mad because his mom got him a puppy that was missing a leg. I felt like he was totally being judge-ful 'cause once he saw the puppy he felt happy but when he saw it was missing a leg he threw it down. He was feeling a bit playful and wanted to play. A bit annoyed that the puppy with the missing leg was asking to play when it could barely walk. I felt like he was totally neglecting it. He was feeling happy that they got to go outside. The boy was feeling happy when he finally realized how good of a pet it was. I felt like he finally opened his heart, once again, to the puppy.
