No. I had no clue what it's about. Well, the boy was playing on the Xbox. I know what Xbox looks like because I have played on it over ten times. And the boy got a present. It was a puppy. A newborn puppy. He didn't like it, so he just said, "Get lost, go away, get lost." So the puppy found his spider ball, so he went to it, but it was the cabinet so he smacked his head into the cabinet. But then the second time, he got the ball. He was rolling around playing with it. Then came to the boy with the ball. He looked at the puppy and he got on his stilts and he went play with the puppy. And also, they're going out to play fetch. About that movie? I didn't like any of that. I'm more into things like Despicable Me and more interesting stuff than that. That its just like boring. It wasn't just an interesting movie that I enjoy. It's like a movie that you would watch if you're watching like Paw Patrol. Paw Patrol is just like a simple show. It's not even good. Kind of boring. It's just boring. The mom. The puppy. Playing on the Xbox. The ball. I don't know. That one I really didn't know. Okay. Happy. Happy. Bored. All I felt was ... Sad. Annoyed. I felt really stressed. I didn't want to watch it even. Yeah. That's what I ... That part. He was feeling ... He looked like he was going to cry. Angry. Ow. No. Something just hurt me. This slinky. At least it didn't go all the way through my skin but ... But it's bad. That's not bleeding. At least it didn't go through all the way. Bored. That part I did not even like. I was bored too. Happy. Happy, too. Still bored. I was feeling a little like I had to scratch my nose.
