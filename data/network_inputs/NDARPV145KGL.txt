I think I have, yeah. Well, it started with this boy and he seemed very antisocial because he was playing video games and his mom said it was a beautiful day and he was just ignoring his mom. So he was back to his game but he also ... later on he found this box in the middle of the table and he was really curious what was inside of it. And, I think the mom said to open it, so he opened it and he found a puppy. But then he thought the puppy was really cool but when he picked up the puppy and found the leg, he didn't like it so he threw the puppy on the floor. And then, the puppy wanted to play with him but he just kept on ignoring it but later on he decided to like the puppy; so he actually got up and got the red ball and went outside to play with it. Um- I liked how it shows that it doesn't really matter what you look like. That's basically it. Do I have to say? I didn't like that he was not really social. His mom. A puppy. Video games. A red ball. Because the boy doesn't have a leg and the puppy doesn't have a leg. Very excited. He felt really excited, too. I felt happy for him. He was excited and then when he threw him on the ground, he felt upset and- The boy was really happy and then when he noticed the leg, he got upset with his mom. Maybe because he had no leg, and he probably thought it was kind of offensive or something. Kind of sad. Kind of sad. The boy was feeling angry. Sad and angry. Very, very happy. Happy and grateful. Probably grateful and happy.
