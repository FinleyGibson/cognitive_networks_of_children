The last movie? Yeah. I saw it on the second test. The beginning he was playing some violent video game like Call of Duty. So after that, the mother brings the box. It's a present for him, so it's a big surprise. So his mother got upstairs and have a call and after he stopped playing video games, he just opened the box and there's a puppy with the left arm missing, so he was like, "Ugh." So he was excited because he saw a kid so he was getting close to him and he just  so he just bring the ball to him so he just throw him back. So he's chasing the ball so inside the box he was kind of funny. So the boy so he's happy and laughing. So he got up. In the end, they have a good walk. No. Just that's it. Just like the boy loved the dog. Just the kicking. The mother. The puppy. He was opening it and saw a puppy with no arm and he's like, "Ugh." He was playing some Call of Duty. The ball. They were the same because they were born without some kind of different body. All right. Feeling happy, excited. A little happy. Kind of good. Feeling a little sad because he's mad because he has a left arm missing. A little tiny bit mad. A little meh. A little bit of happier. So the boy is like he start playing mature games. No clue. Kind of meh. All right. Feeling excited because the boy was throwing the ball. They were just playing catch. Happier. Happier too.
