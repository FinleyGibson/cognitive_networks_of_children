Yeah. No. The mom got a new dog and the boy wasn't that excited; he was just playing his video games all day. And then he started to like it so he went on a walk with it and he played with the red ball. The dog was trying to get the red ball and then he got a little squished. The end. That the boy wasn't actually going on his video games all day and playing with the dog. That ... when he was, the beginning when he wasn't really doing anything with the dog. The dog? Oh, the mom. The dog. He was playing video games. The red ball. They ... They both like to play outside? Really good. Happy. I felt excited. Very energetic. Annoyed. I thought it was funny. He's ... The puppy is starting to annoy the boy again. Very annoyed. Surprised? I felt happy. Very ... Now he's feeling more energetic. He was feeling ... happy. I was a little surprised. Because the boy was actually playing with it. And when he was on the crutches, his leg was half off. It was so creepy. Weird.
