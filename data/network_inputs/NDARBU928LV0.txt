Yeah. Despicable Me? Of Despicable Me? The mom got the kid a dog and at first, he didn't want it cause he was playing a video game and at the end, I saw that he lost a leg, just like the dog. The dog found a red ball and he wanted the boy to throw it so he could get it. That they're both missing a leg. At first, that he didn't want the puppy. The mom. The dog. He was playing a video game. A ball. Cause they're both missing a leg. Both. Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad. Mad. Sad. Sad. Mad. Mad. Happy. Happy. Happy.
