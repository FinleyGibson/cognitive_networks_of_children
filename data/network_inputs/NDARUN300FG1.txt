No. The last one? The kid was playing a game, but then the mom gave him a gift, which is a dog. And then the dog wanted to play with a ball. Okay. No, I don't know. The dog was playing the ball and the kid was playing his game. I don't remember. Yes. The mom did. A dog. Giving the dogs. Playing his game. A ball. Some of their body parts are like lost. Happy. Happy too. Happy. After when he that, he was so happy, he wanted to play so ... Disgust. A little bit disgust too, but ... Still happy after that clip. He's still. Disgust too. Well, I'm surprised how he can still stand with one arm. Happy. Happy too. Happy.
