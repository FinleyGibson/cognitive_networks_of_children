No. You see, there was a boy who was playing on his Xbox but then he received a present. Which is, the one armed dog. But, the boy decided to play fetch with him but accidentally discovered he has one leg.                     That's all.
 Nope. I don't know. I mean, playing with the puppy. Him being distracted by the Xbox. His mother. The puppy. Playing on his Xbox. A red ball. They both have missing parts in the body. The boy. Happy. Surprised. But, then when he took a look at the puppy, at the puppy's arm, he didn't look interested. I felt happy. Upset. Mad. Shocked. Sad. Whatever. Bad. I mean distracted. Disappointed. But, later. Happy. The same thing. I almost felt like crying.
