No. Okay. First this boy, he always wanted to play video games so he didn't pay attention. Then his mom said, sorry he's late. Then the mom put a box in front of it. He kept playing video games. Then, I think the TV turned off. I think he turned it off. Then he opened it and it was a dog with like half, no arm, no leg, and he started playing video games and pushed him away. He was still playing video games. Then when he gave him the ball, he was starting to like him. When he went outside he didn't have a leg. Both of them. No. They both have something in common. They didn't have both arms, both legs. The mom. A dog. Playing video games. Huh? A ball. They both don't have legs? Both of them. Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy but the boy wasn't. Because he was mad too. He's mad because he didn't have a leg. Sad. Happy. Mad. Both mad and sad. Happy, even the boy. Happy. Happy.
