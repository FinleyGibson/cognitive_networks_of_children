No. He got a present. He didn't like it ... he didn't like the dog that his mom got him. Then he realized that the dog was just trying to play with him. And I think, that's it. Not really. I'm trying to give like a short explanation. Everything? So, he was playing this game and then his mom came home. There was this box and it was a present for him. He opened it and there was a dog. Then, the dog found a ball and he wanted to play with him. Then we was moving around in the box. So then he realized the dog was trying to play with him and he went outside to play with it. Nothing. Nothing. No. I kinda liked that he wanted to play with him at the end. His mom. The dog. Playing a game. The ball. They ... Yes. They are both mammals. When you think about it, dogs and humans aren't that different. No, not anything else, I can say. Wait, wait! They both have hair. Dogs have  more hair. Okay. Happy. Happy, too. But then he started to get a little mad and- Happy. I wasn't really affected about my feelings. I didn't really feel anything. Kind of sad. Mad. Same answer. I don't feel emotions when I'm watching something. Still a little sad. Still mad. My answer is going to be, I don't know. Okay. I think they were both happy. Yeah. Happy, too. Happy.
