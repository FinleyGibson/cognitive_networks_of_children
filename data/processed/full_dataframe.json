But I didn't know that at first, I thought he was just sitting down playing video games. Then the dog had the same thing, he had three, he has ... A dog that supposed to have four legs, but he only has three. And when he walks, he kind of stops, rolls over a little bit cause he only has three and a half basically. And not the whole, and not four whole legs. So they're just like each other.                     The boy didn't want to play with it, didn't want to play with him. Then he realized that he had the same problem that he had, so then they went outside and played fetch. \n I remember that the mom brung the box down to Ted like is this for you? Then went upstairs. And the box had the dog in it. I liked that there was a dog included, cause I like dogs a lot. I like that the dog had the same disability that the boy had. So they both were in the same boat basically. Some of the things that I didn't like about the movie was when the boy didn't know that he had the same disability that he had, he kept kicking the dog over, and he kept ... He kicked the dog and that's not good. You shouldn't kick the dog even though you don't like it. So that's the part that I didn't really like. The mom gave the box to the boy. The dog. Playing video games. The ball. They both have, they both have one leg that's cut or that they don't have the paw, and they don't have the foot. They both have that basically the same.

Mad, angry, upset. I felt sad that the boy knocked the dog over. Sad. How he tried again to play and all that, then he just kicked him over said, \"Get lost.\" Aggravated, and annoyed. I felt like the dog was trying to work with him. But stay with him even though he knocked him over again. Knocked him over for and I feel  and I feel like the boy should have played with him before then. Excited and happy that the boy finally wanted to play with him. The boy was feeling like, happy I'd say. Happy and bled happy. He's feeling happy. I felt like, I felt happy watching this clip cause the boy actually wants to play with the dog. And that's good, so I felt happy.","NDARRM467NP2":"What one? No. The mom said, \"Go outside.

It was something like .                     It's not what happens in the movie, but that's the noisiness from the MRI thingy?\n Her Mom, like, put a box there, and when she opened it, it was like  a dog that came out. And then, dog landed on the floor, and I think he did something, like, he licked him the first time, or something, but then like he, like went on his leg, or something, I mean like went like that, and he's like get off, and that happened like a few times, or something happened, and he's like get off, or he's like . And then, like, soon after that, he got up, and we figured out that half of his leg is missing, I think. Like, or his ear, some of it. And then, he like had these things, and he went outside, and he threw the ball a little bit. That's what I remember. I don't think so. Well, I thought it was cool to be about that dog, and then ... I knew that. It was just a ball that he, like, threw sometimes, a little bit, and the dog tried to get it. Well, is there supposed ... I don't know the movie, like, you stopped it at the beginning. Like, I don't know the whole movie so like ... That was? No, that was the end of the movie, when I saw that. I like that story. Yeah. No. I just don't feel like that boy was so nice to the dog.

Like, it can sometimes make you happy, but like it's not like the happy, happy, kind of happy. It makes you feel like ... Aww. That's sweet. That kind of happy.\n Okay. Sad, a little bit, when he dropped him off. Ewww. That's disgusting. I feel like the boy wasn't being nice. Sad. Like, get off of me. Why are you bothering me? I feel like the boy wasn't being nice.

I guess it was ... it wasn't a city because the house seemed like pretty big and he definitely had a backyard so it didn't really seem like it was in a city. I guess ... I don't know. I liked it, I just don't know exactly what I liked about it. I just liked it. I guess like the animations were cool, I guess. I don't really not like anything about it. It was pretty cool. His mom.

When he opened it, he saw a dog. The dog was kind of ... When he was running he kept falling and looked like he only had three legs. After the dog wanted to play with him with the ball he had, the red ball the dog had, he got up and he had crutches. When he got up they went to go play outside, and he told his mom that they were going to play outside. Then they started to go outside and they were playing fetch. I don't know. Nothing really. His mom. A dog. Playing video games. A red ball. They both ... they couldn't really walk perfectly. Okay. Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad. Mad. Sad. Sad. Mad. Sad. Happy. Happy. Happy.","NDARMP745EAC":"Nope, I haven't seen it. What was it called? The Present. I've never saw that before. Well there was a kid, who I believe couldn't like, walk, so he needed the two things that help you walk. He was playing a video game on there, and he was really excited. His mom told him to open the present, and inside was a puppy. The puppy, at first the boy just like, kicked away the puppy, didn't want anything to do with it. Then eventually, he decided to go outside with the puppy, and that's when I found out he couldn't walk on his own, because he had that thing. That's basically where movie ended. The story? Do I remember anything else? His mom came home with the present, told him to open it. I remember at one point, the puppy went under like the ... The cupboard, where they had all that stuff. He went under there and got a ball, and then one point he was playing around with a box. The boy decided that he wanted to play with him. That's when the boy went outside and told his mom that he was going to be outside with the puppy. I think it was funny. I don't know. His mom. A puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They both ... I don't know. Okay. Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad. Like, angry. Confused. Sad. Angry. Sad. Happy. Happy. This might feel weird, but sad. I think it's sad that he only had one leg. What happened to his other leg?","NDARYL758JGG":"Yeah. Okay. I guess it starts off with a kid playing video games. He is like a shut in, kind of so. When his mom comes home, she brings him a present and that kind of makes him want to get up from the game until he realizes what the present is. And he gets a dog but the dog is missing a leg. So at first, he seems he doesn't really want the dog because it's missing a leg until he starts to realize that they have so much in common. After, it starts playing around with a ball, and because of that, he gets up from his game. It's shown that he's also missing a leg, so maybe that's one of the reasons why he didn't want the dog. He starts playing with the dog and that's the reason why he gets up. No, not really. I just like the message that not everyone has to be, I guess, normal in order for them to have similarities, or you don't have to judge someone or something by appearance or how it may be different or similar to you. I don't really dislike anything about it, yeah. His mom. A dog. He's playing a video game. A ball. First of all, they're both, I think that's really ... They're both missing a leg. That's the big similarity that they have. Yeah. It seemed like it really wanted to see him, like it was excited to meet a new owner, and he also seemed like he was excited at first. Yeah, he was very excited. He seemed like that was something that he really wanted, I guess until he noticed, yeah. I felt kind of happy for the puppy and the boy, I guess, because it's like he's experienced something new. I guess it seemed like it was still pretty happy because I know that pets don't usually, they don't really seem to judge that much on a lot of humans, I guess. So, even though it was thrown on the ground, it seemed like it still was willing to give him a chance. He was upset because he wanted a puppy with four legs rather than three. I guess, pretty upset at the kid because that was like a really not good thing to do. I still think that it was pretty fine even though it got kicked. I still think that it was just thinking that it was still so excited to meet someone new, that it didn't really think that much of it because it was still making an effort to become friends with him. He was still upset and he just went back to his game. Same was way as the previous clip, like upset at him because that's a mean thing to do. Yeah. I think it was feeling happy because it was finally able to get this new person to play with it willingly, yeah. I think they were both sharing the same feelings, especially because he finally got up from bring like a shut in and he finally found a way that he was able to go outside and also have fun at the same time. I guess I felt like relieved that he didn't have the same feelings towards the dog as he did earlier on, yeah. Both.","NDARBR740NKV":"Yeah, I saw it on Twitter once, that little video. It's cute. This boy gets a present from his mom, and it's a dog. I was like, \"Who puts a dog in a box like that and doesn't tell anybody who that is,\" but whatever. The dog is disabled like him. It's like a nice little thing, because at first, he doesn't like him, because you know, he's disabled, whatever, like doesn't have an arm. But then, I don't know. They get along at the end. It was cute. The dog is cute. I did not like ... Oh, well, he was rude at first. He was, you know, not accepting of the dog. I was like, \"Oh my god. Why would you be mean to him just because of that?\" You know? The mom. The dog. Playing video games. A little red ball. They both don't have a limb. Excited. Oh, he was excited, too, and then he realized that he didn't have a arm. Then he was like ... after, but that wasn't in the clip. Fine. Well, I don't think he was too affected, but I could tell that he was rude as fuck, you know? He was mad, I guess. I was annoyed, because I don't like people treating dogs like that and like ... Poor mom. He was sad that he kicked him. Oh, he was feeling mean. I don't know, like ... Happy. Same. Yeah. Good. He accepted him now and they're like the same. It's so cute.","NDARCR499NE4":"No The thing that happened in that story was the beginning was when the boy didn't want a dog and he said he didn't like a dog with no leg but he didn't have a leg so they had something in common. And then in the middle, he thought the dog was cute and then started going outside and then at the end he wanted some time to play with the dog so he told his mom that he'll do the other thing soon. I think that was it. I liked nothing about the movie. All of the things I did not like about the movie. I do not like the part when the dog and the boy have no leg and walking outside. I didn't like the part when they got the dog. I didn't like the part when he was playing the video game. I didn't like the part when it just started. I didn't like the part  I didn't like the end. I didn't like before the beginning. The boy's mom. A dog. Distracted by the video game. The ball. Because they were both playing with something and they both had no hand or no leg. What? No. The puppy was feeling happy. He was feeling disgusted by it because it had no arm and then he said \"Ew.\" Yeah.

Sad a little bit 'cause his owner threw him on the floor and didn't like that he didn't have a leg. Mad and sad because he didn't have a leg and the dog didn't have a leg, so he was like, \"This dog would be useless to play with.\" I felt sad because I wouldn't treat an animal like that and it's bad to be mean to other animals. And he didn't even think to say \"Thank you\" to his mom that she got him the dog. Sad again because the owner kicked him and the dog got on his back and could barely even get up.

I don't know. Happy and excited to play with his owner because he finally got up out of his game to play with him.

So he was back to his game but he also ... later on he found this box in the middle of the table and he was really curious what was inside of it. And, I think the mom said to open it, so he opened it and he found a puppy. But then he thought the puppy was really cool but when he picked up the puppy and found the leg, he didn't like it so he threw the puppy on the floor. And then, the puppy wanted to play with him but he just kept on ignoring it but later on he decided to like the puppy; so he actually got up and got the red ball and went outside to play with it.

Like, he was like trying hard to ignore him. But he like couldn't because of the way the dog was just acting. I liked that the dog was just silly. It got stuck in the box and running around. That was just funny to me that the dog just got stuck in the box and just kept falling and kept trying. It just didn't stop. I didn't like when he saw there was something wrong with the dog that he just threw him away. I didn't like that. Like he was just like there's something wrong with you.

I think the puppy felt hurt at first because he like threw him on the ground ...  And it just felt a little sad but then got distracted and kind of fun again. Upset, because I think he felt like his mom was trying to change his mind. Like if it doesn't matter for the dog then it doesn't matter for you. That's how I felt like his mom was trying to show him kind of ... I think the puppy felt confused, because he was happy and now he's just like kicking him away ... I think he just felt confused. I can't say it, annoyed. Like he just felt annoyed because of the dog and he was just like a little bit mad. I was like \"Why did you do that?\" I didn't get it. Because like at the end I got it ... At the beginning I was like \"Why did you kick the puppy?\" I didn't see nothing wrong with the dog. It just didn't have like one arm, but I was like \"Wow, okay. If someone did that to you, you wouldn't like it.\" But at the end he was just like the dog so ... Happy. I think the boy felt happy, too. I ... I ... I liked how it end ... Because then he finally just accepted it and they were just like having fun. They were just like ... They were just kind of like the same. Like he noticed that they were the same and he was just like let me just have fun with it. So, I liked it.","NDARJY141RFE":"No So the boy was playing a video game and his mom comes into the house with a box and she gives it to him but he doesn't look at it cause he's really interested in the video game, and then she says \"Why don't you stop playing and look at the present I gave you?\"                     And then she goes upstairs and he puts down his video game and he opens the box and he sees a puppy and for a second he likes it and he holds it but then he's just like \"yuck\" and he throws it on the floor and then he kicks it and he says \"You've gotta be kidding me.\" And then the dog tries to get the boy's attention but he just goes back to his video game.\n Well, I basically liked all of it so ... His mother. A puppy. Playing his video game. The ball. Um ... Excited. Excited. Kind of sad that he threw him out on the floor. Um well I don't really know how to say  so but he was like, he didn't really like the puppy. He wanted to play with the boy and then the boy just kicked him away and so he was sad.

Excited to meet his new owner. Happy. I didn't have much feelings. I was tired. So that part of the movie, how do you think the puppy was feeling? And how do you think the boy was feeling? And how did you feel when you watched this part? Here's another one. The puppy was feeling a bit energetic cuz he wanted to play with his owner. But, then he felt declined. The boy was feeling stubborn and angry. A bit more aware, I was tired. And that's probably the same answer you're gonna hear for like ... Happy, cuz he wasn't left alone anymore. Happy, cuz he ...

And the kid said, \"mom,\" because he was playing a video game. That he didn't play with the dog. Mom. A dog. Playing a video game. A ball. Because they're both, I think, boys.

That his mom told him to stop playing video games. That it includes a dog, and I think it's really sweet. That the boy didn't play with the dog in the first place, because the dog's more important than the video game. His mother. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. They both like to play. Okay ...

He was excited about the dog until he realized that it had ... One leg was ... That the dog didn't have one leg. And he didn't like that so he threw the dog. But, the dog saw a ball and wanted to play with it. So the dog got the ball and tried to play with the ball, with the boy. But, the boy was dismissive. But, the dog continued to play with the ball and when the boy kicked the ball, he went after it. When the boy,  and the dog struggled getting the ball because he was missing a leg.                     But, when the boy realized that the dog was pretty persistent and didn't really give up, and still kept a good attitude, and wanted to keep playing, he gave the dog a chance. When he realized how persistent the dog was he went outside to go play with the dog and that's when you realize that the boy also has amputated leg. He goes outside to play with the dog. Yeah.\n Um.                     Well, the boy.\n I liked that it showed that no matter what physical hindrances you may have or what ever ... That ... I mean.                     Well, one thing about the movie is that he switched from being on the couch playing video games to like wanting to go, to going outside and being active. I like that it showed that even with disabilities, you can be active and do things that other normal people. Normal, well what ever normal is, that you're still normal even if you have certain disabilities. Yeah.\n I don't know. I didn't really dislike anything. His mother. A dog. Playing a video game.

And then at the end what happened was, all the sudden, then he noticed how him and the dog are similar because of their disability. And then they started to become friends, and they went outside and they played fetch with the red ball.\n I remember that in the beginning he wouldn't go outside and he didn't help his mother pack or unpack. And he was addicted to his video games, and when the mother opened the curtain, he was acting like he was blind and he couldn't see. What I liked about the movie was because ... I would say that you can ... It takes a while ... I would say that it has multiple themes in it. And that, I also like it because it's showing how you can have a connection with a dog. Even if you have a disability, you can always find the right dog. What I didn't like is in the beginning when the mom got the dog, and the boy just kept on pushing him and kicking him, and when the dog was falling, the boy didn't help him up. His mother. A puppy with a missing leg. He was playing his video game in the dark. A red ball. They both have a disability, missing a leg. Mm-hmm (affirmative).

At my school. In writing class. We were doing a response on it. In the beginning; the boy's mom brings in a present, which is the dog.

But, then, when he saw how playful it was, he decided that he should give it a chance and it made him really happy when he finally got with it. He also had only one ... He had to use a cast to walk since he also was missing a foot. What I liked was that the boy actually found acceptance to the dog. Was when he neglected it, because it had the same symptoms as him. His mother. The puppy. Playing video games. The red ball. Then, he wanted his owner to play fetch with him. They both have missing a foot. Okay. Yes.

I felt like he was totally being judge-ful 'cause once he saw the puppy he felt happy but when he saw it was missing a leg he threw it down. He was feeling a bit playful and wanted to play. A bit annoyed that the puppy with the missing leg was asking to play when it could barely walk. I felt like he was totally neglecting it. He was feeling happy that they got to go outside.

I thought it was cool cause then I looked closely and I saw how the dog was handicapped with him. Before, I saw that the kid was handicapped, I was just not looking at the bottom of it. Little sad but it still seemed happy. He was mad, disappointed. Probably because the dog was missing a leg and stuff. I think he took a little too rough on the dog. He didn't have to throw the dog and stuff, you know. The puppy was still happy, I still could tell, but it was probably like, \"He kicked me but I only just get back up and try annoying him again.\" He was still ... I guess he was mad. He seemed mad about the fact that his mom got him a puppy instead of maybe like another game or something like that. Also disappointed that he had to throw the dog and kick it. Happy.

He opens it and he sees that it's a puppy and he's like, \"Aw this is so cool.\" And he picks up the puppy and he realizes that it's missing its front left leg. And immediately he's like, \"Ew gross.\" And I think he literally drops it on the floor. And the puppy is determined obviously. But I think it's more just it's playful and innocent. So it's trying to play with him, playing with the ball. He's watching it and he's trying not to get invested in it. And he watches it for just a couple of minutes. And he's like, \"Alright fine.\" Wins him over. And he picks up the ball. And then when he stands up he reveals that he's missing a leg as well. So, and then it ends with him going out with the puppy to play. It's a puppy (laughs). It was very realistic, just to the puppy.

I saw that when he got up, he had a lost leg and the dog had a lost arm and then when he threw the ball in the kitchen, the dog went to fetch it, he saw that him and the dog were the same just because they lost some body parts like the dog lost his arm and the human had lost his leg. Yeah I remembered that when his mom brought the present, he wasn't really focused on it just because he wanted to play the rest of his video games, do some stuff on his video stuff but then after a while he just started to pay more attention. And his mom said, \"Are you going to open the present?\" And after a while, when his mom was gone, he opened the present to see what was in there. Some of the things that I liked about the movie was the part with the dog just because I really like dogs and the part that the human and the dog actually were bonding together and the boy liked the dog just because he had the same thing in common as the boy. Mostly the things I did not like about the movie is when the boy kicked the dog in his stomach. I felt like that was disrespectful to the dog because he was just a baby and he probably thinks that the dog doesn't know much better. The mother just because the mother wanted the boy to pay more attention to everything else. A dog, that is the same as the boy just because they have lost body parts. Before he was given the box, he was focused on his video games and his mom placed a box in front of him, he leaned to the side so he could see his video game more, but then when he shut the thing off he actually paid more attention. A red ball that dogs really like balls and that's because a ball gives a dog an attention like he can play more with you and he can have more fun with the person. The puppy and the boy are the same, like I said, same body parts but also they like to both play with stuff. The dog plays with a ball and a human plays with games or other people and the human and the dog are also the same that's because they are like both playful, the boy likes to play games but he also likes to play with the dog now too. The boy is a missing a leg, that's because the dog as hind legs and the dog had a front arm that was missing. He was feeling excited just because now he had an owner but when he was back somewhere else, he was feeling really sad just because he didn't have nobody to love or play with. When he first got the puppy he was just feeling happy and when I heard the whoa he was like really surprised that he got a dog in the box. I feel like really happy that the dog finally got a home in someone else's home because now he has an owner, somebody to love, somebody to play with, somebody to walk with instead of being alone. He was feeling sad, that's because the boy just thrown him down on the floor instead of like placing him down on the floor, instead he just threw like that because that was really disrespectful to the dog. He was feeling like really upset for some reason just because of the dog only saw his lost arm. I felt when I watched this part, I felt like really bad for the dog that the boy doesn't really like the dog even though some dogs are different and the same. I felt really said for the dog. He was feeling not cared about just because the human kicked the dog when he said, \"Get lost.\" Mad just because the dog, he saw something that was really upsetting to him or he was just mad for some reason that the dog did something or just because they are the same personalities. I felt like the boy and the dog were not getting along at this part and at the end they were, so I felt like this part they were not getting along but I think the next day they're were going to get along. He was feeling really happy now that the boy actually paid attention to him instead of throwing him down and not paying attention and just continued to play his video games. The boy's actually feeling happy now just because him and the dog are now bonding, the boy he now likes the dog just because the dog was like a baby and he really likes the baby dog just because he was cute and funny because I saw that he was laughing but just also just stopped laughing because he didn't want to show the dog that he liked it. I felt when I watched this part that, I actually felt like they were going to be friends forever but the dog actually felt like the boy was watching him and paying attention to him, instead now he'll be paying attention to the dog instead of playing video games or he'll kind of be letting the dog do both, he'll probably take him outside for a walk just because now he likes him.","NDARTX795AKR":"No. So, the girls in the movie delivered girl scout cookies. And like ... Yeah. They both have dogs. Okay. So, at first the boy did not like his dog, but then he adjusted really quick.  play with the dog. And, that's all that I got to watch. There was no more. The MRI was over after that part. That there was a puppy, because I love puppies. Did not like that he didn't like the dog, because it's a puppy. Who doesn't like a cute puppy? I did not get to hear that part, because of the beeping. It was the dog. The minute he opened the box a dog just po, jumped out. He was playing video games, but I really want to see, because video games are my favorite thing in the world. Puppy was playing with, a red ball. And, he went outside to play catch since dogs are really good at catch. They both have one leg that isn't entirely a leg. Okay. He was really happy. Happy too. I felt like I was, like I had the puppy. Puppy was feeling really sad. The boy was feeling upset. Because, he wanted the puppy to have all four legs. I felt like I, I felt like, if this actually happened with a boy in real life. That I saw, I'd be super sad. Puppy was feeling more sad. The boy was feeling very, very upset. I felt like, he was trying to concentrate on his video game and I really want to see it. Told you. Awesome. Boy was feeling super happy. I felt like, if I had a puppy, I would like him to, I would still want him to have four legs.","NDARET550NXC":"What? The Despicable Me one? No I haven't seen it. Well basically, this one boy, he was playing video games and his mom got him a dog. The boy just wanted to keep playing video games and then later he saw the dog was playful and stuff so  decided he wanted to play with him outside. No. I liked that the ending was a happy ending because he wanted to play outside with the dog. Something I didn't like about the movie was that the boy shunned the dog away and just wanted to keep playing video games. His mom. A dog. He was playing video games. A ball. They're both handicaps. Think the puppy was feeling excited. The boy was also feeling excited about having a dog. I felt, both satisfied and angry, because of the different . I think that the puppy was feeling sad that the boy shunned him away. The boy is feeling angry that the dog was handicapped or something. I feel angry because even though if a dog is handicapped you shouldn't shun it away. I think the puppy was feeling sad because he wanted to play with the boy but the boy didn't wanna play with him. The boy was still feeling angry and just wanted to play video games. I felt angry because the boy was still shunning the dog away. I think the puppy is feeling happy that the boy finally wanted to play with him. I think the boy is also feeling happy 'cause he was playing with the dog. I feel happy because, the boy didn't feel angry anymore and wanted to play with the dog.","NDARZT096AUP":"What last movie? Oh yeah, no. The last story? That he got a dog, but he didn't like the dog because he had one leg missing. But that's actually kind of creepy. It's really creepy. I don't know, I didn't watch the whole movie. No. Mm-hmm (affirmative). That the boy would try to pretend he was missing one leg to and he had some crunches. Crutches. So he can lead the dog out or no. He was trying to play with the dog. Could I do like the different movie? Or no? Oh, okay. Well, I love dogs. I love dogs. And it was all about a dog. Was it a puppy or dog? I love puppies and dogs. Of the one leg dog? It's so creepy, ew. Disgusts me. His mom. A dog ... a puppy. He was still playing the game. The ball. Because they do the same thing. The puppy, the puppy. Why did you just ask me that question? That's so scary. Mm-hmm (affirmative) Oh, both, both! Okay. So he was stop the game and then he stopped the puppy. But he noticed he was missing a leg. He was feeling excited. I can tell. He was feeling ... well when he saw his leg he felt disgust. What part? It was freaky. Freaky! I did not see the one dog leg. Because the dog had a missing leg. Why was his leg missing? Mm-hmm (affirmative), yes, I saw it. Why was he missing a leg? Did he got ... his leg got cut off? He was feeling bad. Because the boy kicked the puppy. Angry. Mm-hmm (affirmative) Because I saw his mad face. Well, I don't like when someone kick ... well, I don't want someone kicking a puppy. So, I felt bad watching this part because no one kicks puppies. Their cute. Wait, we're watching another clip of the movie? And look, so now he's ... He was feeling happy, but he was kind of rolling around. He didn't know what was going on, so I think he felt a little dumb. Well, when he saw the puppy, he got the box, he was smiling in sort of way. But, he was more focusing on the game. I felt good. Oh another clip? Seriously? Ah, look! Look at him. Did he miss a leg? Did he like push his leg up the sleeve? He didn't push his leg up the sleeve? Where is it then? How you think the puppies feeling? He was feeling good, he was feeling happy. He was feeling excited. That's it? I was feeling good because the puppy and the boy was like getting along. That's it? Thank you.","NDARPL201YL4":"No. Got it. So basically what, in the start, the kid was just playing, he kept playing video games. His mom tried to give him a present and he was just like, \"Get out of the way, I'm trying to play.\" And eventually he opened the box, and a puppy came out. At first, he acted friendly to the puppy but then he didn't because it was starting to interrupt his game. The puppy started playing around on its own. He made a noise at it a few times. Didn't really look like he wanted to play with it. That was the beginning and the middle. Then the end, he took a bit of sympathy toward the dog, got up, even though he had crutches and had to use them. He went outside with the dog and played with him. Not exactly. So the dog wanted to play with him and he just wanted to play video games. How it showed that people shouldn't always play video games and it shows the companionship between an owner and their pet. That he was pretty mean to the dog and he was caring too much about the video game. Even when, if I'm playing or if I'm watching something, I pause it and look up or if I can't stop the game, because I have games like Clash of Clans or Clash Royale, I try to listen while I'm doing it because that game is kind of risk, those games are kind or risky because if you don't do something right, like, you have to fight other people. Not exactly that bad, but you lose trophies and like stuff like that. So I try my best to be able to communicate with people even though I have a screen in front of me. I try my best to communicate. The mom. A puppy. Just trying to play video games. A ball. He just happened to find. They're both pretty friendly and they're both kind of disabled because the dog was really young so he couldn't really run and then the boy his leg, something happened to his leg, so he had crutches. That's one thing. That's only on the outside, that's physically. And then mentally, once he actually went to the dog and accepted him they had a really fun time and he really liked him and the dog really liked him. I think both because the puppy stumbled a few times. Even though it was only a few feet, he stumbled. K Very happy to have an owner because I think he might have not had an owner. Maybe he was like rescued. At first happy. I liked it because he was actually being nice to the dog. A little playful but if I were the puppy I think I'd feel a little sad because someone just threw me on the floor for no good reason. Just because he panted a bit, the dog, and of his tongue, the boy thought he was disgusting. If I had the dog I would have liked the dog and played with him even if I did have a disabled leg. I have never had a disabled leg, but my mom has and even though it is hard to recover you should try to make the best out of maybe walking around sometimes so you can get stronger and he has a pet. We have cats not dogs, but still. We care for 'em. Still a little playful because he didn't understand yet since he was young, that the boy didn't really want him around. Annoyed because the puppy won't let him play his video game and is barking. I think he was being too mean to the puppy. Happy because his owner was actually playing with him. Also happy because I think that he had something more to do than just play video games all day now. I liked it because they were actually showing a bond.","NDARTN487KDK":"Uh ... I can't. Mm ...

I didn't need that part, that was pretty scary. And I like the other one because it was so cute and adorable with the little jolly man.

The first part was pretty cool and the second, well I didn't like that he had chips on the floor lying down there. And I couldn't see because I was about to cry.

Both. Happy. Excited. Well, what do you mean by that? What do you mean by that? Excited. Sad. Angry. I loved the . Sad. Extremely mad. A little mad. Happy. Happy. Happy.","NDAREK549XUQ":"No. Well, the boy was playing video games and then his Mom came with a package and then opened the curtain and he's like, \"Huh?\" And then he was like,  and then he had the puppy picked up and then when he saw it had one leg he kind of you know, threw it off to one side.                     But the puppy was very determined. When he's upside down.  he's like  and run towards it and then the boy kinda got interested but he was trying not to admit it to himself. And then, well, then the dog, then he kicked a ball back into the box. The dog ran into the box, tumbled a little bit and then when he got in the box, fell on it and landed the box on him. And then he got the box off and they played, then the boy got crutches and went out to the yard and then they played.\n And that's when it ended. It's hard to say. It's hard to stay  when you haven't, you know, just hard to talk about stories sometimes. I like how it had a happy ending so ... That's probably what I thought was the best part. Probably the fact about the kid throwing the dog. That's probably the only part I didn't really like so ... His Mom. A puppy. Video games. A ball. They both were missing one leg. Both. Very happy. Very happy also. Very happy as well. Very unhappy, but very determined at the same time. Disgusted. Probably a little freaked out like, \"What the heck is he doing?\" Very unloved. Probably same as the first clip. Disgusted. Terrified, like, \"What?\" Okay.","NDARFT881VT6":"The puppy dog? The kid was playing video games, so his mom bought him a dog. Then he was kicking the dog, then the dog got the ball and wanted to play. And the end, the kid went outside. Yes. They played outside. Outside the dog found the ball ... before they went outside. I don't know. The sounds. The mom. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. They were both living things. Both. How are they missing a leg? Why are they missing- Happy. Happy. Happy. He missed a leg. Upset. Upset. No, weirded out. Happy. Not really. Good. So ... I wonder if the boy- Upset still. Sad. Upset. Sad or upset. Okay. He's missing a leg. His leg got chopped off? Happy. Happy. Happy.","NDARVY366HWJ":"I can't remember. Okay. So, there was this boy and he got this box. And there's  and his mom told him that it was from his cousin. And then he opened it really quick and then he saw a puppy in it. He jumped out. And then he was holding him and they were like \"Ew.\" And he threw him down. And then  ... I can't remember the rest. Yes. He kicked the ball and he went outside and that's it. When it was running it was, like, falling. Like ... I don't know. The mother. A pup. Playing a game. The ball. They both like to play. Okay. Okay. Happy. Happy. Middle. Sad. Sad. Medium. Sad. Mad. Medium. Happy. Happy. Medium. Yeah.","NDARFV557XAA":"Only on YouTube, I guess. I don't know. I watched it on YouTube. I forgot that he had that missing leg. Okay, so the boy, he was playing a video game. I think he was playing like a game, like he's in war and he's in a jet. He's trying to shoot other people in the other jets. So he was trying to play that ... This is the middle ... So the mom comes on, he brings them up that present. I forgot that was the one missing leg dog. So he didn't even like it. He looked on the missing paw. He didn't like it. He also said, \"Scram\" and \"Get lost.\" That kid was very mean to his own dog.                     Then at the end, I didn't realize he had that one missing leg. I never looked at that part. I never looked at it. \n Well, I know the mom is talking to somebody, and I know she went upstairs, but there's one thing that was ... I think I saw the jet playing game, but he paused it because he didn't like it. He might crash, like go down and crash. So that's why he might have paused it. I don't know. But it was awesome. Now am I gonna watch Despicable Me? The dog. Yeah. That he was being mean to the dog. The mother. A dog. He'd been mean to the dog. He was playing some video games. The ball. Oh, they have the missing leg. Great. He was smiling. He looked like he was very playful. Very sad because he had the missing ... Missing leg. I felt sad about the boy and the dog with the missing leg and the other missing leg. A little sad ... A little sad. I really wanted to cry about that part. A little bad ... A bad person. He feels a little bad. Then when he gets happier because the dog, he wants to play outside. Like a little bad. I felt a little sad about the dog.                     This is not blood, but I don't know why that's there. It's probably from the Dorito. I eat Doritos a lot.\n A little sad because he got flipped over and he says, \"Get lost.\" A little more bad. A little sad, again. A little more sad. Okay.                     Why are you like ... Why are you like ... When you showed me .\n A little happier. Like, really happy. And now I'm feeling so good on that one. Happy, not bad anymore. He's good this time. Happy. Like, extremely happy.","NDARXU253JHC":"No. What happened in the beginning was his mom came home. He was playing video games. She gave him a present. He opened the present and he actually found a dog. When he looked at his leg, he was missing a leg. He threw him on the ground, the puppy kept on coming back, he kept on pushing him away. Then he found the ball, he started smiling, but he kept on pretending he was mad. Then he went and he threw the ball, like he kicked it, but after that they started playing together. They went outside and they had fun. It turned out he lost his leg too. No. That they both had missing legs and they were very compared. There were a lot of things that were the same. Nothing. His mother. A puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They both have no leg. Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad. Mad. Sad. Sad. Mad. Sad. Very excited. Very excited. Very, very happy.","NDARCP057XJB":"No, I have not. There was a kid playing a video game. His Mother came home and was like, \"Hey, I brought you a present\". He's like, \"I don't care. I want to play my video game\". And then he opened it, and it was a puppy. He was like, \"Cool, a puppy\". And then he realized the puppy was missing a leg and he was like \"I do not want this broken dog\" so he threw the puppy on the ground and kept playing his video game.                     But the puppy was very energetic and started running around and the kid took no interest in this poor pup. And  like swatting him out of the way. Eventually the puppy found a ball and brought him the ball and started playing with the ball. \n Not really. I liked the plot twist at the end. I liked the character development you could say within the few minutes the movie went on. I mean, I didn't dis ... There wasn't anything that I specifically disliked about it. I didn't not like it. His Mother did. A puppy. Playing a video game. A red ball. They're both missing a leg. Both. He seemed very happy to have an alleged new friend. He also seemed very excited about getting a puppy. I was like, \"Yay puppy!\" And I like dogs, so ... Sad! He was thrown on the ground! I don't know, like a brat. I don't ... he was angry because his puppy was missing a leg. I was angry. He was a good ... that puppy did nothing! He did nothing. I mean in the beginning he got right back up but then the boy kicked him to the side. And he probably was not very happy about that. Annoyed that he now had this broken pup in his life that he did not ask for. I just continually felt bad for the puppy. He did nothing wrong. Seemed very happy. That's a very energetic puppy when they were going outside. I mean he was beginning to warm up to the dog so that's nice. I mean I was glad it was working out. That he could appreciate this innocent puppy.","NDARTJ032FJ2":"Yep. Like five times. Well, the boy ...  you recording right now? Okay. The boy was playing video games and his mom came in and told him to ... what do you call it ... to get outside. Then she went upstairs because she was on the phone and told him to open a present. There was a dog missing a hand and the boy picked it up all happy and whatever. Then he realized the dog didn't have a hand, so he threw it on the floor and was disgusted with it.                     Then the dog was upside down, and he realized the ball under the ... what was it ... like a cabinet? It was a red ball.  He threw it to the boy, and the boy kicked it away in the box. And the dog went to it but he tripped twice because he didn't have a hand. He was in the box. The dog toppled over him. Then the ball went right in front of the boy. The dog tried to get to him. He tripped once or twice. And it got to him. Then ... where am I up to? ... then the boy decided he wanted to play with the dog. Then at the end you see him on his crutches and he's missing half of a leg. Then he went outside with the dog.\n He said \"Mom, I'm going to be outside.\" Well before you thought the boy was nasty because you didn't know he didn't have a leg or whatever. Then at the end you realized he's the same as the dog. He threw the dog on the floor. His mom. The little dog. He was playing video games. A red ball. They're both missing half a limb or a whole limb. Happy and loved ... Like, finally someone wants me. He was excited and happy. I don't know, I felt it was very cute. Like, typical. Wow, this guy changed his mind in two seconds. Disgusted. Sad. Angry. Annoyed. It mad me angry at the boy ... ... and sad for the dog. Overjoyed and happy. Yep. And the boy. Yeah. The boy felt love for the dog. I just felt happy for the both of them.","NDARGH634ME7":"Yeah. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe. The cute little movie, when he opened the box he was like ... and he was missing an arm but he looked at him and he had soft heart and he said... He throwed the dog on the floor and kicked him. And then he was ... He went outside. So then at the end, he said, we need him. The door. And at the Minions, I'm waiting on the guys that keeped the door, they wanted like ... They sleeping there. But somebody picked them up and then, that's where they're home. So in that's the dog that I see'd when they were wheeling him into the house. And they moved, and spooned . And then the girl went down to the guards like then they broke her pony, so on the Minions, then the father said they are cousins, and then ... Oh. Yeah. And he throwed the ball. And he hold on to it because he wanted to play outside with the puppy. And the last part, when we are about to leave, they like to go to play outside. And the dog too, and they are fetching. And then ... And I remember something like ... It was like ... There was a girl and she said \"open the box.\" But he was too busy playing the video game. And that was the puppy inside it. And the puppy jumped up, and the boy was watching the video games because he didn't open his box.                     Somebody would come on, his dad and they both have a box. And they opened the box, and there was a puppy and a card inside. There's two pets. Then, they took them back to the pet store. But they bought them again. They went to the pet store and got them.\n I like, one of my favorite parts was when he jumped up. Yeah. The one I don't like, about the movie, its like he's sewing his soft paws and I don't like soft paws. Mommy. The puppy. Watching the video games. But he was watching the video games, and he went about and he didn't opened. I guess he got ...  like. 'Cause they both like to play outside. The boy. Okay. Here. Look, watch this. He jumped . Watch this. . Happy. And the boy was happy. But watch this. Watch this. What happened he stopped , and then he will push him. Like push him. And push him on the ground. Like kick him. He was kicking him a lot. Good. Oh, this is the boy. He was so close. There. And then he do this. Sad. I think sad. Angry. He- He don't like his present. But at the end, he like his present. Good. And he kicked him. And he kicked him. And he said ... Sad. Ang- He's said, \"Get away little stinker.\" Sad. Good. Okay. And then he said, \"Mom, we will be outside.\" And then- Happy. Happy. Happy.","NDARCL016NHB":"No. A boy, who was playing video games all day, his mom brought him home a box, and she said that it was a present for him. He paused his game, and he opened the box, and a puppy lept out. At first, he was like \"Oh, it's a puppy. I've always wanted a dog.\" Then he realized that the dog only had three legs. Either he had been in an accident, and lost one of his legs, or he was born that way. That made the boy not like him that much, so he pushed the dog away. Then the dog saw this red ball, and he pushed it towards the boy. The boy still didn't like the dog, probably because he only had three legs. The dog kept on being very charming, and he kept on falling over, because he only had three legs. The boy thought that was kind of cute. The dog nudged him so that they could go outside. He got up, and then you realized that he only had two legs, the boy. At the end, they went outside, and the boy had crutches, and they played outside. Good short. No. The dog kept on falling over, because he only had three legs. I really like the dog, because I've seen cats with three legs, but I've never seen a dog with three legs before. How the boy was mean to the dog, at first, because I don't feel that that's very realistic. I think that the boy would have liked the dog, because he had three legs, because he would have been like him. His mom. A dog, with three legs. Playing a video game on the couch. A red ball. They both have one less leg than they should have. Mm-hmm (affirmative). I felt that he... It looked like he was feeling excited, because he had been in a box for a long time, and because he lept out with a lot of energy. Also excited, because he had just opened a box and a puppy was inside it. How would you feel? I don't know. Neutral, because I've seen that type of clip a lot of times, where a boy gets a dog. It's not really original, but I still felt for him because it was cute with the puppy. I felt like the boy was being really rude. I think the puppy was confused, but he didn't really know what was going on. I felt that the boy was being very rude. Disappointed. Still very excited, but more confused. Disappointed, but mad. Still felt that the boy was being rude. Excited. Excited. Mm (neutral)","NDARMZ518UH1":"I saw it at the Child Mind Institute. But I didn't see that broken leg. How did he get a broken leg? Did he kick ... maybe he kicked the dog a lot. Because when you kick dogs a lot, it might be growing up and then you might get a broken leg. Okay. With the minions? Try to tell the whole story. Then what happened? Then what happened? Yeah. And then the boy, and then the dog was going next to him and then the boy kicked him. And then he did it again, then he kicked him. And then he was like this ... And then they became friends. No, just that. I only like the minion movie. And it was super funny when the one start dance with the robots. I like it when they become friends. I didn't like when he kicked the dog. The mom. The dog. Playing video games. The ball. They're both playing. The boy. Are we going to watch in the computer? Happy. I mean great, I mean excited. Embarrassed. He was like ... oh wait, he was happy. I feeled a little bit sad because they became mad and then they were friends. I feeled kind of bored. He drops the dog. Sad and excited. Mad. Kind of sad. Okay. And then he did ... and then the dog did this and then the boy did something. He hurt him and then he said, \"Get lost!\" Sad. Angry. Sad. How did he break his leg? Hey, and then they grew, and then they played catch in their back yard. Super happy. Super happy too. Super happy.","NDARCW094JCG":"Yeah. Like what movie? Oh. He was playing video games and then his mother ... He got a box and then there was a dog in there but then he was being mean to the dog, to the blue dog. Then when she ... When he found the ball then when he was walking to him he started playing with the dog and going outside with him and playing ball with him. No. When the dog came and when he got the box. That his foot, one of his foots were missing. His mother. A dog. He was playing video games. The ball. They both like each other. Okay. Happy. Kind of not happy. Happy.

And he got, his mom brought ... came in and put a box, which was his present on the table. He opened it and there was a dog but he was missing one of his front legs.                     So then he basically didn't like that, so he threw him on the floor. Kicked him away. But then after a couple of times, then the dog basically fell in the box and it made him laugh. So then he went out with the dog and then it appeared to be that he was missing a leg too.\n Not really. Well, the fact that he was missing a leg too. That he ditched the dog around. His mom. A dog.

Okay.","NDARBJ159HXB":"No. This boy is getting a present. It was a dog. The dog wanted to play with him. He took out this rubber ball. It was red. He kept trying to chase it and play fetch.

A puppy, or a dog. He was playing video games. The puppy was playing with the ball. They both feel they want to play with something, but someone else doesn't want them to play with it. The boy. Okay. He's feeling excited. He thought it was cool. Like the puppy only wanted an owner. The boy he mighta been wanting a puppy. Okay. Confused. He didn't realize that the puppy, he really didn't want it. That the puppy was being neglected. The puppy must've been sad. I think that he was feeling the boy didn't want him. He didn't want the puppy. The boy didn't really want the puppy. He was feeling like the boy actually wanted him again. The puppy wasn't that bad. The boy liked the boy after. The boy.","NDAREN519BLJ":"Yes. Not sure. I don't have a good memory. Yeah I'm not sure. Um. When the girls had to leave. Yep. Actually no. There was a kid, mom and a dog in a box. The mom came home with a little surprise. The kid was playing video games and then he opened the box and he found that it was a puppy. Then he saw that the puppy didn't really have his paw and then through him on the floor and it wasn't being nice. Then the dog he found the ball and he wanted him to play with him but he threw it and he pushed it with his head next to his foot and he kicked it away. The dog was like a puppy so he didn't know. He thought he was playing. Then the ball it went in a box and the dog went in the box and he was having trouble running to it. He was having trouble getting out of the box because of his paw. He tried to get out a couple times and he couldn't then he tried harder and he got out. Then the next try he did they went out and they played catch. No. That there was a puppy. How the puppy didn't really have a paw and that kid didn't really have a leg. His mom. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. They both kind of didn't leg. Yep. Happy. Happy. Well excited. I felt happy. Sad. Grossed out. Sad. Sad and mad. Like weird. Really sad. Excited and happy. Happy. Happy and excited.","NDARDN489EXJ":"Yes. Okay. The mom, there was a boy on the couch playing Xbox, or any other game system it was. The mom walked through the door with a box. She placed it in front of the boy. She was on the phone, I believe, and walked upstairs or in to the kitchen. The boy put the game on pause and placed the controller aside him. He opened the box just a little bit and the dog popped out in excitement. The boy was happy, too, but when he lifted up the dog, he realized that the dog had an amputated left arm. He didn't really like it. I don't know why. He tossed him to the floor and he continued to play the game.                     The guys scootched up by leg, and he kicked the dog aside. The dog was on his back, and he saw the ball underneath the ... whatever, the desk, or whatever. It was a red ball, and the dog went to retrieve the dumb ball, and he got the ball. The boy looked at the dog while he was going underneath the table. Then, he looked back up at the game. The ball hit the boy, and the dog did a face. I think the boy kicked it into the box, and the dog went to go get the ball. He was limping a little bit, and tumbling, and falling. He ran into the box, and the box flipped over him. The boy looked up over the game and looked at the box to make sure the dog was okay or whatever. The box, the dog was trying to get out the box, so he started moving around a lot. The boy shook his head. He was like, \"I don't care about this,\" and looked back to the game. \n From this story? The story was sad, but fun at the same time because both of them have a common trait of not ... probably being picked on, from the dog being a dog, like inside of the adoption clinic. He was probably being picked on by other pups. The boy is probably picked on at school, so they share a similar experiences in life from losing limbs. That he started to care for the dog. He started to care for the dog because he felt bad because it was just the same as him. But I can say the dog was little more stable than him because he has three other legs, but still weren't being  and stuff. I can say, probably like at the end of the movie, they became really good friends and stuff. That he didn't appreciate the dog when he first saw the amputated leg, arm. The mother. The box was a brownish- Oh, what was in the box? A dog. Playing video games. A red ball. They have one lost, amputated limb on the left side of their body. Oh, that's actually like ... The boy. All right. That's fine. I know dogs can stand on their front legs. Puppy was feeling excited to be, to have an owner that thought, cared for him, and would play with him, and help him grow, and they would be together forever. The boy was feeling real happy at first. He was like, \"Oh, this is great. Like better than a video game,\" but he turned the dog a little bit to the side and he saw that it had an amputated leg or arm and threw him to the floor. When I watched that part, when he threw the dog to the floor, I didn't really feel good about it because it's another system in this world. You have to take care of it, and give it care, and love, and affection just as you would expect your parents to give you. You have to treat care of the animal. When the puppy was in midair going towards the floor, I think he didn't really know what was happening, but he felt a little unappreciated. That's it. Disgusted. Unbelieved. Confused. Aggravated. Angry. The puppy was feeling better than before. I can definitely tell that. The boy was feeling a lot happier to have someone, a companion that shares similar emotions to him. Happy.","NDARJV268PNW":"No. It started out, like, this boy, and he looked like he was kinda like, really, addicted to playing video games. And then his mom came home with a dog, well, a present, and he opened it, and it was a dog. And he wasn't being very nice to the dog. And the dog tried to play with him, and he just kept kicking him away. And then, he noticed something about the dog, that he didn't have a full limb. And then, he looked at it, and he kinda got happy with it. And then, he picked up the  outside. And then he walked, and then noticed that he also didn't have a full leg, too. No. I like that he eventually loved the dog. That he was being mean to the dog. His mom. A dog. Playing video games all the time. Huh? A ball. They both don't have a full limb. Okay. Happy that he has an owner. Oh, a dog. To me, it kinda looked like he was feeling happy, but not that happy. It made me feel happy for the dog, that he has a home. That made me feel kind of upset that he just threw the dog. Not that happy. Frustrated. Kind of upset. Still, not that great, because he kept kicking him aside. Again, kinda mad that the dog just kept bothering him. Kind of upset that someone would treat a dog that way. That one made me feel happy, because the dog and the boy were playing, and it's like he stopped playing video games to go hang out with the dog, and they both were playing with the ball. Happy. Happy. Very happy.","NDAREH074NG8":"First, there was a boy. Then his mom gave him a present. Then when he was playing a game, he didn't want to open the present, but then he opened it and then he found a dog. Then he didn't care about the dog. Then when the dog was happy to see him, he kept looking away from it and didn't play with him. Then when the dog made the boy happy, then they went outside to play. That you should always care for others. I have a question. Why did the boy and the dog didn't have the other legs. Nothing else. I just liked that part. I didn't like about that movie is that the boy didn't care for the dog. His mom. The dog. He was playing his video game. The ball and then he was playing with the ball. Because they both have the other legs not on. Happy, and the boy was feeling happy. I was feeling a little bit friendly, but I was feeling a little bit happy and friendly. Now the boy is mad. Happy. Mad. I was feeling a little bit sad. Happy still, and the boy was feeling mad still. Sad still. Mm-hmm (affirmative). Happy, and the boy was feeling happy too.","NDAREM703YFD":"Yeah. Okay. So the beginning was  There was a doggy in a box. He opened it, and he wanted to play catch. He wanted to play, and he was getting  He was on a journey, he said, \"Mom! I'm throw a ball for doggy.\" And he went outside and did it. That's the endings. No. I liked when the puppy lick, the puppy lick  out of the box, I liked that part. The one when the boy's angry, I don't like that part. The mom. The dog. He opened it. I mean. Ball. Fun. Hmm. He was nice puppy. Neither. He opened the box. He says, \"Whoa, cool.\" Happy. Mad. I liked it. That's the part when I liked it. Hmm... Happy. Angry because he didn't like the dog. I liked it. This one, I liked it. Playtime. He wants to play. Angry, because he didn't like the dog. I didn't like it. That's the part I like, I like that part. This is that. Then they go outside, and they catch. And he throws the ball. He throws the ball. Playtime, so he liked it. He wanted to play. Happy. I liked it.","NDAREY778CR9":"That was a lot easier than I thought. Yes. Actually, when I was at the Child's Brain Institute in  Island, I saw that one. Yeah, it was when I was doing the EEG. In the beginning, it's a boy that's playing video games, and his mom walks in, and she puts a box on the table in front of him, and she opens the blinds, which kind of annoys him, because he can't see his video game. And she says that he has a phone call, and asks if he can open his present.                     After a while, he gets kind of curious about what's in it, and he finds a dog, but it has one leg that's been amputated. And for some reason, he doesn't like the fact that it's missing one leg, and he thinks that it's weird and disgusting, so he puts it down on the floor by throwing it, and basically, starts to play video games again.\n Well, it did sound like, that he was playing one of those video games that sounds like it's fighting. And the dog was really excited, and it wanted to do everything, and play, have fun. I loved the amount, how the dog, even though he was missing one leg, was still able to run and play, and how they were kind of a match for each other, in ways, helping each other understand. It doesn't explain much. From the beginning, it doesn't explain how this happened, like how he doesn't have a missing leg. It just starts off with putting a present on the table, and it doesn't give any details about what happened before. His mother. A dog that was missing a leg. He was playing a video game. A red rubber ball. They're both missing a leg. Excited, and happy, and really curious, at least some ways. Excited and happy. Excited and happy too. I kind of got how they were feeling. Who doesn't want to find a little, cute puppy, who's all happy and wants to jump around and have fun ? I think he kind of felt a little bit abused, and he didn't know why he was being thrown. Annoyed and disgusted. I felt really annoyed and angry to the boy . He threw a cute little puppy on the floor just because he was missing a leg. I mean, who does that? He's a cute little puppy. Still kind of abused, but he wanted to still have fun, even though he'd just been thrown on the floor. And he really wanted the boy's attention, and he wanted to play. He was still feeling disgusted and stuff. And he was getting angry now that it just came back up to him and started annoying him when he was already doing something. Still angry at the boy, because why would anybody wanna do that to a pup? I feel kind of angry at the boy.

His leg is broken so he was running. Then his leg was broken so he couldn't run so he was running, then he was flipping out all over the place. Then the boy's leg was broken. They were playing catch outside. No. Then ... Well, there's only one thing. Why does that boy have nobody? That's the only thing. There's not that much I could explain. No, cause it was so sad. Well, not to me. It wasn't sad. Everything. See, the reason is that I didn't like everything is because ... I don't know what to say but we like ... I just don't know ... Because we're like watching the movie instead of being in the movies and then we don't have to watch it again. Even though we know what happen in the movie and then we like ... We do all the playing and then we can remember that movie. Then we can just think about  We can just watch the clip. Nobody. No. Dog. Playing a video game. A ball. Cause they were playing with ... Playing. The leg is the difference .... That they're not the same type. At first ... Stop the clip. Stop. Stop it. I can't tell. Both. Kay. So happy that he had an owner. Yeah. I my ear. Happy too. I didn't see nothing. I didn't see nothing. I didn't see the movie. I only see the part when his legs broke ... When their legs were broken. I felt nothing. So sad. Mad. Wait, easily? I don't know. I don't know. I don't feel no emotions yet. The last clip? Not too much happy because when you like ... It's like you don't ... Having something that you don't like and just get it and then you just start liking it. I think ... I don't got much to say about the boy. Nothing. The last one. You're not even looking at the clip. Can you see it? How? Like hugged. He felt happy. One question, when did you get that camera? I ain't got no more questions. I ain't got nothing to say. I ain't got nothing to say. Nothing to say. I didn't see the puppy. I didn't see the puppy but I only see the boy. Not when he turned around. I didn't see and play ... I didn't see them play. Just now. My head still feels goopy. I ain't got nothing to say.","NDARNM783ZVV":"No. So, the boy didn't ... Was playing video games when his mom came home. And, she brought a present for him. And, he opened the present and it was a puppy with only three legs. And, he didn't want him. So he  him on the floor and kicked him around. And, then the puppy found the ball. And then went out to play because the boy was also missing a leg. So they became friends. His mom went upstairs on a call. I don't know. I liked the entire thing. No. The mom. The puppy with three legs. Playing video games. The ball. They both wanted to play. Both of them. Okay. That was a really, really, really short movie. Happy that someone loved him. But, as soon as the boy saw that he only had three legs, he was like, \"No, I don't want this puppy.\" But, he actually liked the puppy. He just didn't like that he had three legs. Happy that he had a puppy. I don't know. I didn't really feel anything. All I felt was that I had a headache and that I'm exhausted. Okay. Sad. Unhappy because the puppy only had three legs. Again, I don't feel anything. Just really tired. Left out. Burned out so unhappy that the puppy only had three legs. Again, nothing. Okay. I think they both felt so happy. Happy. Happy. Nothing. Besides exhaustion.","NDARTW850GHU":"Well, I saw some kid playing a video game, then his mom brought in a box, or something. I didn't know it was going to be an adult, but it's disabled, like with one arm lost. You clearly can't see that the kid is disabled too, but first he didn't want a dog, and then he saw he couldn't walk, so he threw the ball. That's all I can really remember. Oh no, I think I can remember he tried to take a call, and the dog kept falling. He had these crutches, I don't know what they are called, but there were like two, so you could put a grip; it's like a cane, but with two handles. Trying to remember. He got off the game to go outside with the dog and play with him. That's really what it was mostly ... I think it was only like two minutes, so that's all I really got out of it. Which one, the first one or the second one? I like how the dog was barking, because I know a lot of dogs and I have one myself and it always barks. It's annoying, but at the same time its funny. So I guess I can relate to it. He was rude to that dog. It doesn't matter whether you like animals or not, you still shouldn't treat it like its a piece of garbage. So, that's what I thought. The mom. A dog. He was playing games on the TV, or whatever. Could be XBOX, I think. A ball. A red one. They are both disabled. I guess you can say that, not to be rude or anything. And they both like to play games. So I guess that's how I seen it. I think both, because I don't know if it is an arm for the dog, but they have four legs, so I am guessing a leg. Happy, I guess. It saw a human. I don't know, I'm just guessing. I thought he was happy too because it was different, but at the same time both shocked. I guess, like any other kid would, happy to get a dog. I already have one, so I'm used to it. Sad. He just threw him. THat's messed up. I think he was mad, I guess, because he was disabled. I don't know. I was mad. I would be so happy if I had a disabled puppy, no matter what was wrong with it. That's just my opinion. He was happy at the beginning, but after he got kicked, I think he was mad. He is still pissed off. Still same, like mad, because I don't know why somebody would do that to an animal. Happy. And then the boy was feeling was happy too, if that was your next question. Better, because I don't like Kevin, like I said. Both.","NDARPW635LN4":"No. I only saw the beginning. Not really. Yeah. It was a boy who ... loved playing video games and ... his mom got him a dog. He went outside with his dog. That was all I saw. I didn't like it. Everything. His mom. His dog. Playing video games. The ball. They both liked to play. Happy and excited. Same way. Not happy. Sad. Sad. Sad. Sad. Sad. Sad. Happy. Happy. Hap ... Sad.","NDARUT470BM4":"Yes, I have. It started out, there was boy playing video games. Some kind of shooter or something like that. With lots of guns and explosions. And then his mother came home with a box, and she put down the box for him it was a present, it was a gift. He didn't really pay attention to it. But eventually, he opened it, there was a little puppy in it. The puppy was missing its left forearm, leg. Anyways, and he wasn't thrilled, to say the least. Kind of cared more about the game, he kind of put the puppy down. And then they went outside and played. Just like, details? The mom meant to send a paper to someone that didn't go through. It's strange where he lives, it just kind ... I know it's just because they probably didn't want to fill in with the background, but he just lives in the middle of nowhere. It was cute. I mean, the puppy was cute. The puppy seemed very real, just kind of running around, barking. It was a sweet little connection they had at the end. It was a good short film; it was kind of keeping it short, concise, and just yeah ... sweet. I mean, I'm sure it had some kind of moral message; it personally didn't resonate with me all too much. But I couldn't really see anything specific that was trying to say something larger. It just kind of seemed to be; I guess, you know, they both have disability I suppose. That connection between the two despite the fact that they initially didn't really get along too well. But ... I mean it works, it just ... Yeah, I think it's just me. It's ... it's short.... The mom. A puppy. A little golden retriever. It seems. Playing some sort of PS shooter video game? A ball, red ball. And he was playing with an Xbox, the most original Xbox. Interesting. They're both missing a left leg. Both. Ecstatic. It's a person, the person's holding him. He was in a box before and now he's not. I think first happy that he had a puppy. I think in that moment, he was like, \"Whoa, that's a dog.\" But then ... It was cute. Sweet.  Cute. I don't think he cared or noticed all too much. I think he was just kind like, \"wee.\" Because like, I don't think ... because I definitely think the puppy at some point, if that continued, would definitely feel kind of hurt. But I think the puppy didn't really care in that sense. I think it was just kind of happy. Still. I think he definitely was not happy. He was, he felt almost betrayed by his mom and disgusted that the puppy also, well not also ... maybe also ... didn't have a leg and what a garbage, defective puppy. Asshole. Am I allowed to say that? Am I allowed to say that? Maybe a little more defeated, but I also, I still don't think the puppy really cared still. I think the puppy was just happy to be in a place with a person still. Just annoyed. Just like ... probably a little bit disappointed, because it's like, \"oh, there was a puppy;\" but then for whatever reason he doesn't like this puppy because it doesn't have a leg. And he's just disappointed, if anything, but I think he also just doesn't care about the puppy. I think he's more invested in his game. It's just a mean thing to do. I mean ... Very, very happy. The puppy ... this ball, that's the greatest thing in the world. The ball's flying and I can run after it. Woohoo! It's very happy. Satisfied. I think he was, like, realizing that there's, you know, there's a connection there. And he was like, \"You know, maybe this puppy isn't bad, maybe this puppy can be a puppy. And that's, like, amazing.\" It was cute. It was nice. I felt satisfied as well. It was a nice ending. You know, the short didn't call for anything super dramatic. It was a sweet little thing.","NDARDL129FV3":"? No, I never saw that one. So in the video I seen, the boy was playing Call of Duty and then his mom came and she bought him a dog and he was being mean to the dog. And then that's when he realized the dog had three legs and that's when he picked up the ball. And then when he walked outside, he only had one leg technically like the dog. The dog kept falling when he was trying to walk. When the dog kept getting back up. When he kicked the dog. His mother. The dog. Playing the game. The red ball. They both have a missing body part. Both. Happy that he met somebody like him. He was happy. I was confused. A little sad. Angry. Why would he throw the dog? Like \"why'd he hit me?\" He was still angry. \"Why would you hit the dog? He felt better because he realized the boy had a missing leg like him. The boy felt the same as how the puppy felt. I was surprised that the boy had one leg.","NDARMU053YEU":"Okay.                     At first a kid was playing a video game, then his mom came home and brought a present.

I do not like ... cause the dog do not have an arm or the kid did not have a leg. The mom. The dog. Playing video games, and I already said that part. The red ball, and I also said that. Cause the dog did not have an arm and the boy did not have a leg. You're using that computer? Joyful cause he found a new family. He was very happy when he got him, but then when he saw him without the arm, he didn't feel happy and he throw him. I felt happy that he got a new dog, but I did not feel happy when he throw the puppy. Because my brother would be so mad if he watched that movie cause he loves puppies. We have a puppy at our house.

So he puts down his controller and opens it and finds a dog. Yeah. And then, in the middle, he finds out that, he sees that the dog has one leg, and he doesn't want the dog because of that. He thinks it's like bad because it has only three legs. And then towards the end, he realizes the dog's just like him, because he has one leg that works, 'cause he doesn't have the other one.

In the beginning of the story, a kid that lost one of his legs was addicted to games, so his mother thought, \"Why don't I buy a puppy that they're kind of like the same, because the puppy lost a leg too.\" The mom also wanted the kid to play with the puppy and be friends and play together. So, in the movie the mom bought the kid a puppy. When the kid saw that the puppy lost a leg, he pushes away the puppy like it doesn't ... Like he doesn't even care about him, and he just pushes him away. The puppy sees a red ball, so he gets the red ball, and he asks the kid, in his own way, to play with him, but the kid said, \"No.\" The puppy tried again, one or two more times, and the last time the kid said, \"Yes.\" At the end, the kid started to like the puppy and decided to start playing with the puppy. I don't remember anything else. I liked that the puppy didn't give up when the kid said no to the puppy when he wanted to play with the puppy. I mean, when the kid didn't want to play with the puppy. I also liked about the movie ... Something else that I liked about the movie is that his mom didn't just let him play all day and actually tried to make him get off the games and all. I did not like ... One thing I did not like about the movie is that when the puppy wanted to play with the kid, the kid just pushed the puppy away like it didn't even matter. Another thing that I didn't like about the movie is ... Another thing I didn't like about the movie is that ... Wait. I forgot. I can't remember. The mom. The mom gave the box to the boy. A puppy. He was playing games, like shooting games. The puppy was playing a red ball that was under a cabinet. The puppy and the boy are the same because they both lost one leg. Okay. I think the puppy was feeling happy and excited that he was finally getting adopted and he was finally going to be a member of a family instead of just being in an old cage or something. At the start, he felt excited and he felt the same as the puppy, but until he saw that the puppy lost a leg, he was like, \"Ew\", and pushed him away and threw him. In the middle, he was like he didn't even care about him. He almost ignored him, like fully ignored him. At the end, he was like ... He knew the puppy wouldn't start giving up and anyways, he liked the puppy, too, at the end, so they started playing together. I felt happy at the start that the puppy was getting adopted and all. In the middle, I felt a little bit sad for the puppy because the kid wouldn't want to play with the puppy when the puppy wanted to play with the kid, with the red ball. At the end, I was really happy that the kid finally agreed to play with the puppy. Okay. I think the puppy was feeling let down and sad that he was thrown away like it didn't even matter. I think the boy was feeling really mad that the mother got him a dog that lost one leg because he thought it was gross and ew. I felt really sad for the puppy because he was thrown away and it might have hurt him. I think the puppy felt let down again. Maybe he was like, \"Oh man, why can't he hug me?\" I think the boy started feeling like he didn't even care about the puppy and he wanted to ignore the puppy, and yeah. I felt a little bit more sadder because the puppy tried to hug him and all, and kiss him, but the kid just threw him away again. Yeah. I think the puppy was feeling really happy and excited that the kid finally agreed with the puppy to finally play with him and the red ball. I think the boy felt happy and ... I think the boy felt the same as the dog, just maybe a little bit ... Maybe just happy for the dog that he's finally excited and more and all.

Then eventually, he warmed up to the dog a bit, and he took him outside. They played. He played with the dog, and then it ended.

He got mad for a few minutes and then finally the dog wanted to play with the ball. And then he just put it in his pocket and then went outside and the dog opened the door frame.                     And then he had his, his things to walk. And then the dog went under him and then they were playing.\n His mom going upstairs. That they got along at the end. That he was like, like rude to the dog and mean. The mom. A doggy. Playing the game. The ball. They both like to play. The boy. Okay. Happy. Happy. Happy. And then in like the middle he started getting- Mad. Like, like mad. Like uncomfortable. Like he doesn't want it at first. Sad. Unplayed with, like he wasn't playing with nobody. He was alone. He wanted to play. Like a little disappointed that his interrupting his game. It's a little rude to the dog and a little mean, meanful. Okay. Happy and the dog was being so nice even though he was being mean to him. Happy. I feel comfortable.","NDARTH473LF8":"No. Well, the kid was playing video games. Then when the mom came home, she brought a box for the kid. It was a present. When the kid opened it, there was a dog, but it only had three legs. Then he pushed away the dog, and the dog found a ball and kept on playing with it. Then the kid turned off the video game, and went outside with the dog. It turned out that he was missing a leg. No. That the kid finally made up with the dog, and started to like it. Nothing really, I like it. The mom. A dog. He was playing a video game. With a red ball. Because they're both missing something. Both. Excited. Excited too. I felt happy for the boy. I feel like, rejected. All mad that the mom had to do this to him. Sad. I think he was feeling rejected again. Sad, and mad that the mom had to give him a dog that only had three legs. I felt mad that boy wouldn't play with the dog. I think he started to feel excited then that the boy was playing with him. Happy that the dog is liking him, and he's playing with him. Happy for the boy and the dog.","NDARZN277NR6":"No. From the beginning? I couldn't really hear, but like, that's why, I think I know ... There's like a little boy, who's playing video games, we couldn't like ... He's just like playing video games. And then he's mom came in, she put like a thing in front of the controller and he was like \"mom, I'm trying to play video games.\" And she was like, \"Okay, open your present,\" and he opened it and it was a dog, and he was like, \"Aww.\" And then he was like, \"Wait, no, I don't like you.\" At first I didn't know why he didn't like the dog, because I thought he was just like, \"Oh, I'm playing video games.\" But then I realized it was because the dog only had like three legs or something. And I was like, \"Oh, that's sad.\" And, I think the dog was trying to get the ball, and he kept failing, cause he couldn't, cause he only had three legs. And I don't know, and the boy probably was like, \"I don't know.\" He was like watching him, and it was like ... I guess he was like amused? And then he ended up picking up the ball and going out to play with him, but then we see that the boy has like one leg, and it's like oh, that's cute. Like his mom got him a dog that has three legs, and he has one leg so it's like cute. I don't know. Just cute. Like what do you mean? Like details? Or messages? Oh, I don't know, I think that the boy was like happy cause he related to the dog. He was like, \"Yeah, same. I feel you man.\" I don't know. I don't know. There was a happy ending. I don't know, it was cute. I mean, I don't know. He was rude to the dog, and I was like, His mother, I'm assuming? Cause he ... A dog. With three legs. He was playing video games. A red ball. Cause they both have like a missing limb. The same one? Can you turn this? He was like, I mean I don't know dogs just like people. I mean that dog was like a friendly dog. He was like, \"Oh yay, an owner.\" Probably couldn't see that the boy had one leg. I can't tell if he noticed the dog had three legs yet. I didn't notice until like I saw the dog running. But maybe, I don't know, cause you couldn't really tell. I feel like he might not have noticed at first. And then he did, and he was like, \"Oh, that's a little weird. I'm gonna put this down now and play my video game.\" I was like, \"Aww, a boy and a dog. That's cute.\" I don't know. I like dogs. Yeah. He was like, I don't know he probably felt like, I mean, he felt bad because the boy threw him on the floor. He was probably, I mean, at first when read it I didn't ... Saw it, not read. When I saw it I didn't really understand because I didn't see the dog only had three legs. But now I know he probably felt like, I don't know, he probably just felt like awkward. He was like, \"Oh I don't want a dog that looks like me.\" I don't know. But then he was like, \"Yeah, never mind. Whatever.\" Well the first time? Like for the first time? Oh like how did I feel when I watched it for the second time, or for the first time? Oh. I mean, like it makes more sense. Like it's not okay, but it makes sense. Like the first time I was just like, why would you just throw a dog on the floor. Like that doesn't make any sense. But, you know ... Whatever. But this time it makes sense cause like, it wasn't like he was allowed, like it's not a good reason to throw a dog on the floor, but it makes more sense. I mean, the same from the first time. Just like, cause he just threw him and then he went back and he was like, \"Nope, don't want you anymore. Kick. Get lost.\" Annoy ... I mean he was probably annoyed, and he probably felt bad, but like, he was like ... I don't know, you can't see it but he probably felt bad, I'm assuming. Cause like then he ends it up not hating the dog, so like he probably ... Because his first reaction was he liked it. And then he didn't like it. I mean, the same as I felt when I watched the first time he reject the dog. I was like why? Like it's a cute dog. Like stop. Ah, that was like good. That was like the, \"Oh I get it!\" Cause like, I don't know it's cute. It's just like ... I don't know. I don't know, he was probably ... This is so cheesy but he was happy? I don't know, like I think, \"Yay!\" He was probably just like ... He probably just accepted it. He's like, \"Yeah, whatever.\" This ... He's just like, \"Okay I'm just gonna like play with this dog. Cute dog.\" I was happy. I was like, \"Yay! He likes the dog now. Finally, God.\"","NDARAV610EY3":"No The kid was playing video games and his mom came and brought him a present and ignored him ... and when he opened the present he saw it was a dog, but saw it was missing a leg, so he just ignored it ... and the dog was trying to play with him and as soon as the kid gave in, the dog and the kids went outside ... and the kid was also missing a leg so, they ended up, I guess, having a lot of fun. Not really. I like the way it had a kid and a dog interacting. I don't really know. The mom. A puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They're both missing a leg. Both. I think the puppy was feeling excited that he has a family now. I also think he was feeling excited and I think, like, he thought the puppy was going to be a really good addition. Pretty happy. I think he was feeling sad and that he was just left alone. Disappointed that the puppy wasn't exactly what he wanted. I felt kind of sad that the boy just dis-offed the puppy. I think he was upset that the kid didn't want to play with him. I think he just didn't like the puppy. I felt kind of mad at the kid. I think the puppy was feeling excited and, like, that the kid wanted to play with him now. I think he was excited that even though the puppy wasn't perfect, it was still really good. I felt happy.","NDARMH249AWF":"He was playing video games and his mom came home with this box and put it right in front of him. And I guess he didn't want to see it because he was too focused on the video game. Then after that he opened it up real quick when she went up the stairs and a dog popped out. He seemed excited to see it until he saw that it was missing a leg. He put it down and stared kicking it to the side. After that the dog started going after the red ball, started running around and it caught his attention. Right then, he thought it was finally funny so he got up. I thought he had both his legs but he got up he was missing half of his other leg. They went outside and from there they just started playing. At the end, where they got along after. When he was kicking the dog aside. His mom. A dog. Playing video games. The red ball. They were both missing ... well he was missing a part of his leg and the dog was missing a part of his leg. Excited to have a new owner? He was excited. I felt good. I think he was feeling a little excited until he got dropped to the floor by the boy. He didn't want the dog because he didn't have no arm. Aggravated. He was trying to get his attention and then when he kicked him the puppy felt like he didn't want him. The owner ... the boy didn't want the dog around. Mad or he didn't want the dog around at all. Aggravated. Happy that somebody finally wanted him. He was happy that he finally ... I guess there was something more similar to him so they were both happy. Good.","NDARHD132KKB":"-this. No. Oh I have seen it. I'll make it short. Boy with one leg opens present. Doesn't like present.

And then he realized he didn't have a leg. And then he was mean to it. And then the dog went to find the ball under the stove, I think. No, it was like, something else. But he went to find it and then he was playing with it. And then the boy realized that he liked the ball and then he got stuck under the box and he flipped it over.

But then the dog found a ball and he wanted to play with the ball so he got it under the furniture and then he started to play with it ... and then the boy realized that he wanted to play ball and then the dog came over and gave the ball to the boy and then the boy actually was like oh cool we can go play ball outside and then they went outside, the dog opened the door for the boy and then they went outside and then the boy actually had a missing leg and he had crutches.

First he doesn't really know what it is, and he can't really walk, 'cause he's also missing a leg. First he just doesn't like the dog, 'cause it's just distracting him and his video game. Then he realizes ... He starts kicking the ball, but then the dog brings it back. When the dog brings it back, it gives him an idea, like to stop playing video games and play outside with him. So, he opens the door, brings the dog out, and plays fetch. There were a lot of bleeping sounds ... be bo bo bo bo bo. The movie. Also, it's weird how he, usually, just tries to kick the dog away, 'cause I like dogs. It's very ... It gives you an idea what to do when you're bored. Instead of playing video games, get up and be active. Like the boy being mad at the dog, kicking him around, kicking the ball away, being all mad about everything. His mom. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. Well, they both are missing a leg, but they both want to do something. Both. Okay. Happy, 'cause he finally has someone to play with. Also, happy, 'cause he also has someone to play with. Very happy. Very sad, 'cause the person he wants to play with threw him. Probably mad, 'cause he's ... I think he thinks the dog is stinky. Sad. Very sad. Distracted or annoyed. Well, I really didn't want it to happen. I mean, I just wished that the boy would just listen to the dog that time and just play with him. At least, pause the video game. Okay. Very happy, 'cause he finally gets to play with him when he's trying to ask him all day.

Then the puppy tried to get the box off, and the boy took the ball, and he told his mom and said, \"Mom, I'm going outside.\" And he was going to play with the puppy, and he had crutches.

It was funny at some points, like with the dog slamming its head and thing. It was heartfelt, like I felt emotion the first time I saw it I felt emotion. It was relatable like the way the kid acted.

It was if you have a disability, you could still do stuff. That was my favorite thing. The boy would sit down and play video games all day. The mom. A puppy. Playing a video game. A ball. They're the same because both of them were busy doing something. The boy was busy with the video game, and the puppy was busy playing with the ball. Okay. I love this. Happy that he got an owner. Excited that he got the puppy at first. I felt overjoyed because that was so cute. Well, after that throw, I think he felt a little broken-hearted. Disgusted because the puppy licked him, and he was like, \"Ew!\". I felt almost broken-hearted because that was a cute little puppy. Again, broken-hearted because the boy just  him. \"C'mon, you see I'm busy.\" Again, broken-hearted. See? The dog's like Doug from Up. Doug from Up, except as puppy form with the big nose, the color, everything. Overjoyed and full-hearted. Excited that he was not staying in the house playing a video game and doing nothing. Hearted.

And then he ... then he felt happy cause he probably doesn't wanna play video games anymore. He like just wants to play with the dog like the whole time. No. Like when he was playing with the dog. And when the dog showed him how fun it could be with no leg. When he hold him and he looked at his leg and he was like this, \"ugh\". His mom. The puppy that had no arm. He went back to play with video games. A ball. A red ball. They're the same because they both don't have a ... no leg. Okay. This happens. That happens when it glitches. Yeah.

Like he showed me to be happy when you saw a dog with no leg ... but you wanna play with him because you don't have leg. That doesn't happen all the time. And when you find a puppy with no leg, do you just wanna play with you from their new home. Cause he wants to see if he likes puppies or not. That's why letting him play with the ball with him. He was feeling sad because he pushed him ... cause he dropped him on the floor. He didn't like the puppy cause he saw him with no leg. I like feel worried about the puppy. When he fell, he couldn't get himself up. He only rolls, when he gets himself up. When regular dogs have legs, they just put one of their leg on the ground and then they stand up with the rest of them ... but that one can't. He was starting to feel happy because, he wanted to show him how puppies are fun. He was feeling ... he was feeling something but I can't remember what it's called. He didn't like the puppy, because it had no leg. But he didn't have no leg, because, he forgot that he didn't have a leg. I felt like, why the boy cannot play with his puppy, because he wants to show him why puppies are friendly, when they see people. They feel excited when they see people ... when they live at the streets. He was feeling happy because the boy wanted to play with him. Cause he saw him playing with the red ball and he was starting to smile. He was feeling happy because the puppy showed how it's fun to be with puppies.

It starts with a boy and he's playing with some video games or something and the mom comes in the room and she's like, oh here's this present or something. There's a box and the kid like, oh I don't really care. The box moves a little bit, which is enticing and then a little puppy pops out and you're like, oh look at the dog. And the kid seems kind of unfeeling and just continued playing his video games and the whole like pup pops out and he only has three legs and you're like awe look at the little guy. He was already cute before and now it's just like I feel bad for him. And he has a little ball and the kid just still is completely disinterested and the dog has the ball and the kid kicks it away cause he doesn't really care but after that the dog gets the ball and you're like oh he just wants to play fetch and he like stumbles a little bit because he only as three legs and he gets the ball and the kid starts becoming interested but he's like oh never mind.                     And then he keeps playing the video games or whatever he was playing and then after that he starts taking more interest in the dog as the dog ... he kicked ... the boy prior had kicked the ball into the box that the dog came in, which was on the floor at this point and the dog stumbles into the box and in doing so the ball flies out of the box and the dog runs with the box on his entire body because he's a little guy. He slams into the dresser, the drawer, whatever the TV's on, and then after that the ball is on the floor. The dog brings the kid the ball and he stumbles to him. The kid is like I'm fine and a smile grows on his face. And he gets up and then you see that the kid only has one leg as well. Yeah.\n I remember he was using an X-Box controller. I remember he was playing first person shooter. I remember it was like a blue something, I forget. I remember the ball rolling over to the fridge. I remember the counter being locked and I remember him leaving the door opened. And the crutch he had was much orange. That's pretty much it. I liked the message. You can have normal actions and still be impaired in some way. And that's kind of motivating and moving. I liked the parallelism between the dog and the boy and the dog had the same, or at least really similar, disability as the child, but the dog stayed happy throughout. And the kid was probably like a sad kid cause he only had one leg. But after playing with the dog, he was like oh yeah I can be happy too, I don't have to just stay here and play video games the entire time. I don't know. It was fine. I liked the animation. I don't know. I couldn't really hear the mom as much, but that was not really due to the movie. Yeah. The mom. The puppy. He was playing video games. A red ball. They're both disabled in the same way. Both. He was probably very happy. Probably also happy, cause now he has a puppy in that moment. I was like oh yeah, the kid has a puppy and the dog only has one leg, wonder if he notices. Kind of little surprised. Yeah. The boy seemed kind of disinterested, like oh it's toy that's broken. Yeah. I was kind of surprised but I had already seen it. I knew what was going to happen. I don't know. The second time around I just thought it was funny how he just tossed the dog aside because no one would actually do that. But yeah, just a little weird. Probably didn't really care. He got back up like immediately. It didn't really seem like he noticed very much. Disinterested, just generally. I was like oh yeah, the dog's probably going to try to reinteract with boy after this. Yeah. Probably happier than he was before because now he's like oh yeah the boy is playing with me. Yay. Yeah. Probably better as well because he's like oh yeah, alright, maybe I shouldn't just treat this dog like a broken toy and instead like a dog. I was like yay, the boy is not a jerk anymore. And he has the dog now. It's better. Yeah.","NDARYL771XDP":"Yes. What, the puppy? I never seen that movie before. I thought you meant Despicable Me 3. He was playing video games, and, then, his mom got a present for him. He opened the present. It was a puppy, but the puppy was missing a leg, like a paw. Then, he started being ... He acted mean to the puppy at first cuz he kicked it and said, \"Get lost.\" Then, the puppy found a red ball, and he threw the ball for the puppy, so the puppy would go away, but then it went into a box and started playing around in the box. Then, he thought the puppy would be a good pet. He went outside with the puppy. He lost a leg too, so they were playing fetch outside. He wanted to stay inside and not go out, but the puppy changed that, so he would go out. I liked that- That they lost a leg. His mom. A puppy. Playing video games. A red ball. The both lost a leg. Happy. Happy. Happy too. Angry. No, the puppy was feeling scared. The boy was feeling angry. Mad at the boy. Sad and alone. Angry. Angry and sad. Happy. Happy. Happy.","NDARPV303LAX":"No. So, his mother came in and had a box and gave it to him. He was still playing his video game. But then he opened the box, and there was a puppy, and he was like, \"Cool.\" And then he saw the puppy had his arm cut off here. So then he's like, \"Ah, disgusting,\" and he threw him aside.                     I felt really sad that the puppy was ... like if you have a puppy that is disabled and has like three legs and one arm. No, two legs and one arm, that's sad. You should care for the dog and be nice to the dog. \n Yeah, so at the end he looked at the dog who was playing with the ball, and then the puppy gave it to him. So then he got the ball and he put it in his pocket. And it appears that he, the boy, didn't have like one leg. So then he played with the dog and was caring to the dog, and he said to his mom, \"We'll be outside.\" The things that I liked about the movie was that I liked that the mom gave him a present, and he cared for the dog at the end. I didn't like that he was still playing his video game when the mom gave him his present, and he threw the dog aside and judged him by how he looked. The mother. The puppy. He was playing his video game. The ball. They liked to play. The boy is missing a leg. Okay. He was feeling excited. Feeling excited also. I felt excited. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Good. Good. Good.","NDARZW930MF2":"No. Okay, so there was a boy who was playing a lot of video games. And his mom thought he was on them too much, and she got him a puppy, which was missing a leg, and the boy thought the puppy was odd. And he didn't really like the puppy. And he just continued playing video games. And then, the puppy brought him a ball, and he threw the ball. And then the puppy did a lot in a box, and then ran around, and eventually got the ball back to him. And then, the boy got pretty annoyed. And he eventually realized to appreciate the dog. No. I liked the story. How short it was. His mom. A puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They both have disabilities. Happy. Happy. Happy. Upset. Sort of weirded out that the puppy was missing a leg. I felt bad for the puppy. Very sad. Angry at the puppy. Still bad for the puppy. Happy. Happy. I felt happy that the boy learned to appreciate the puppy.","NDARDF373ZDW":"No. The boy was playing video games and his mom got him a dog and he didn't know what to do with it. And then he started to play with it at the end. He was trying to like get the dog away from him. He was playing the game system. He was kicking the dog out of his face. His mom. A dog. He was playing games. A ball. They like to play with balls. The boy. Good. Happy. Happy. Fine. Annoyed. So-so. Sad. Angry. Sad. Happy. Happy. Happy. The boy.","NDARNA335GX2":"It's like a real microphone. No. I mean I may remember one. That he kicked it. I don't know. He was playing games. And then he opened a box. Then the puppy jumped out. And then he picked up the puppy. Then he played fetch with the puppy. Then he said ewww, and then he, and then the puppy come back, and then he kicked the puppy. And then he played fetch with the puppy outside. That's it. I liked when the puppy jumped out. I did not like when he kicked the puppy. His mom. A puppy. Huh? No, I said the mom got the box. He was still playing games and then he opened it. A ball. Umm. Yeah. That they knock the both sides and they both don't look like a dog or a human. I mean like the human don't look like a dog or the dog don't look like a human. Neither. Okay. Happy. Mad. I mean sad. A little sad. He was too happy. Mad. I was feeling a little sad. He was a little sad. Mad. I was feeling like the puppy. Okay. Happy. I think he was feeling happy too, because I really didn't saw the face. A little happy. And it made me cry. Because that was the sad part.","NDARCW933FD5":"Yeah. At the Child Mind Institute, the building, they put this weird sticky cap on my head and I had to watch that. Okay. So the boy, he's playing video games. And then his mom comes home and brings him a present and he opens the present and it's a dog that has lost one of its legs. And the boy doesn't really like it because it's lost one of its legs, so it's like, \"Ew, go away. Get away from me.\" So the dog finds a bone and starts playing with it and then he kind of grows on the boy and so he starts playing with the ball a lot and the boy starts smiling. And then the boy takes the ball and he tells his mom he's going to go outside and you find out that he also lost part of his leg, like the dog. And then they go outside and play. Yeah, he was playing a game that involved a lot of moaning because the video game  moaning a lot. I kind of liked where the mom gave him the present. When she said, \"Why don't you open up the present that I gave you?\" And when she opened up the blinds and he's like, \"Meh\" because he couldn't really see the light. I didn't like how the boy was so mean to the dog when he knew that he was like the dog. He also lost part of his leg, so it's like why are you being so rude? He's a lot like you. The mom. A puppy. Playing video games. The ball. They both have lost part of their leg. Very happy because he might have felt finally appreciated. Happy because he had someone to play with, maybe. I felt happy for the boy and the dog because they had companions to hang out with now. Very hurt, mentally and physically. Upset. Very mad at the boy. A little hurt, but ... Still pretty upset. Really mad at the boy. Puppy was feeling really really happy and finally appreciated. Happy to have a companion that's like him. My heart just bloomed with happiness.","NDARWA544RDT":"I'm not sure if I have seen Minions before. I've heard about it. I'm not sure if I've heard about the puppy movie. The puppy was playing with the ball right when the boy video game and the boy got the present. No. I'm not sure. I'm not sure either. His mom. A puppy. Playing the TV game. A ball. They both talked. The boy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Mad. Happy. Happy. Mad. Happy. Why is the boy missing a leg? Why is the boy missing a leg? Happy. Happy. Happy.","NDARMF116AFR":"Yeah. Well, it started out with this boy playing video games at the TV and he's really focused and didn't want to be annoyed by anybody else. And then his mom gives him a box and he's just really not interested and then he opens the box and then he sees a puppy but he notices the puppy is missing a limb. So he kind of just throws it to the side and doesn't care about it. And then the puppy wants attention but he doesn't care and he kicks it and stuff. But then the puppy wants to play a game and he kind of just throws the ball away from the puppy. And then the puppy's just doing the thing like trying to play the game by himself and then he sees that he can still without having that extra leg that he's still able to have fun and play. And so he decides to go play with him outside. That's when they reveal that he's also missing a leg. The puppy was kind of growing really close with him, wanting to play. Well, I liked the dog and I guess seeing the kid kind of realize ... I don't know how to explain it but I guess he was kind of dealing with a little bit of self hatred too until the puppy could help bring him out of that. Well, I didn't like to see the puppy being kicked. He's so cute. His mother. The puppy. He was playing games. The ball. They both are kids, both missing a limb. Okay. Really excited, kind of didn't know what to do. Also excited. I forgot that the puppy was really adorable. Kind of shocked and really . Angry. Disappointed. Neglected and wanted attention. Just annoyed and dismissive. Still bad, disappointed. Again, excited and really just doesn't know what to do with all of this excitement. Enlightened. Happy.","NDARWV487HE0":"No. I don't really remember.Cause, and then I start to close my eyes. And then I keep opening my eyes. I remember the end when the boys playing video games. And his mom brought home a dog that's like him. Cause the dog was missing a leg, and he was missing a leg. So, they both had disabilities. And then, at first he didn't want to play with the dog. He picked up the dog, then he just threw it down. He didn't want to play with the dog. But then, later on, I thought he was just going to let the dog run away, but he went outside, in the yard, in the front yard, to play with the dog. Not really. I liked how the dog was finding things to play with. When the boy threw down the dog. His mom. Well, the woman. The dog. Playing video games. A red ball that he found under the counter. Cause they were both disabled and they were missing a leg. Both of them Happy and excited. Happy and excited. I did .... In that part, how do you think the puppy was feeling? How do you think the boy is feeling? How did you feel when you watched this part? Here's another one. Sad. I think he's still upset. A little mad. Wanted again. Okay and Happy.","NDARDY150ZP9":"No, I haven't seen it. Well, it was about a boy, and he was playing video games a lot. And then his mom came home with a box, and then he was really bothered by it because it was in his view of gaming. And then his mom opened the curtain, and then his eyes returned to normal because he was playing in the dark. And then he kept on playing for a while, but then he was interested in the box, and then he opened it up, a puppy came out, and then, he thinks it's a normal puppy, right?                     And then the puppy came out, he was interested, but the dog peed on him, I guess, a little, and then he threw him on the floor and was abusing the dog a little bit by kicking him. And then I noticed that the dog was three legged. And then afterwards, the dog was upside down because they kicked him, and then the dog saw ... I think he was upside down, but he saw a red ball under a cabinet or something, maybe a refrigerator, I'm not too sure. But the dog found the ball, and a little bit clumsy time trying to get it, but it managed to get it, and then it was stumbling around and he was ... and the boy was still playing video games a lot, but he was from time to time focusing on the dog a little bit, and getting interesting. \n Well, then afterwards he got up and he told his mom that he was going to go outside. And then they threw the ball around, and that was it. It was an accomplishment and inspirational story, and I really like how it was around theme, like to appreciate what you get, and appreciate what you have what now, and what others give you. And that I think he needed a company. He's distracting all the loneliness from him that he had around him, like playing video games. But he didn't know that the loneliness would still be there even if though he would be playing video games. And then, when he found the puppy, he found happiness again. No, nothing at all. His mom. A puppy. He was playing video games. A red ball. They both have something missing in their lives. Both. Okay. Happy. Happy. I felt surprised when I first watched it, and then the second time I watched it I feel happy for them. Bad there. Disgusted. I feel mad a little bit, because he threw the dog, and that made me upset. Ignored. Annoyed. Still mad. Happy- ... overjoyed. Happy. I'm glad. Both.","NDARRB359CRR":"No. Okay. So, they both have two broken legs. The boy didn't want to play with the dog and he kicks the dog away, then the dog decides to play with the ball, then they both go outside. He opens the package and finds a dog, a little puppy. What I liked was the puppy was cute and ... yeah. I don't know. His mother. A puppy. He was playing Call of Duty. The ball. The puppy and the boy are the same because they both have broken legs. I think both of them. Okay. Happy. Happy. Happy. Still happy. Mad. I don't know. I think the puppy was feeling happy. Mad. I don't know, maybe happy. Happy. Happy. I felt happy.","NDARWR732NZE":"I didn't see the present. The little boy, I don't know his name, his mom just gave her a box, and he opened it. It was a dog with a lost leg. And he didn't like it. And the puppy found a ball to play with. He wanted to play with the boy, and he kicked it, and the puppy brought it back. Then, the boy got outside with the ball and threw it to play with. Done.

Then, a few times,  the boy finally says yes. He's like, \"Alright.\" He brings crutches or something and I thought to myself, I was like, \"Wait a second.\" I find out he only has one leg too, just like him. I found out that was a little messed up because he didn't like his own kind. The ball was red. He was playing an Xbox 360 game. About how the dog and the boy got along in the end. How the boy was like \"Get lost\" to the dog, and the dog didn't do anything to him at first. The mom. A dog, a puppy, to be exact. Playing Xbox. A ball. The leg. He felt happy because he got a new owner and also the boy felt like that too. I just said it. I'm like, \"Oh, yay. The dog got adopted.\" Sad. Angry. Pretty pissed off. Sad.

He was so focused on his video games that he didn't really open his present. But when he did, he saw a puppy. And he liked the puppy. Until he saw that he was missing a leg. Then he didn't like him anymore. And then he said, like, \"Scram!\" And then the puppy saw a ball. He went to go get it. And then he brought it over. He just kicked it back. Brought it back over again, kicked it back. And then the next part that I remember is that he got up ... he got up but then I realized that he was actually missing a leg too. And then I think that's all. I do not. That the boy was missing a leg and the dog was missing a leg. So they were actually alike, pretty alike. That the boy tossed the dog, because I love dogs.

Because he did he a new owner and at the end, he still looked fine even when he got kicked away. He was feeling kind of upset or kind of bothered about how the dog kept bothering him. I felt kind of annoyedish because it was really rude even if he don't like the dog, he shouldn't just kick him. The puppy was feeling very excited because the kid start to really like him and they went to play outside. He was also feeling happy and everything.

Happy, because the boy started actually playing with him. Happy. Happy.","NDARCM135DVC":"No. The boy was playing a video game when the mom gave him the box. At the end of the video game he stopped playing and then he opened it. It was a puppy but he didn't know it only had three legs. The other one was missing. Then he threw the puppy on the floor and then the puppy found a ball and then it bumped into the little closet. Then at the end the boy didn't have a leg so he was on crutches and then they went outside to play with the ball. No. That there was a dog and it was a hurt one. I care about it. That's it.

I also remember that at the end he took him out for a walk and he took the dog for a walk to throw the ball. I didn't see enough to know anything that I liked. I think movies, I like movies so much that I don't usually take a favorite part from a movie. I don't have things that I did like or did not like because I just take movies like I like that or sometimes I don't like that. The mom. A puppy. Playing a video game. A ball. They both like to play. I didn't really like it. I didn't like it. But then like throws down the puppy. Sad. Angry. I don't feel anything, I don't do ... I just think like that's a good movie or a bad movie. Okay. He ate a bag of chips. See he ate a bag of chips. Like uncomfortable. Because the boy's getting off and like Upset. Because he didn't want that puppy. I told you. He just gets out of the door.

Well, some things are like ... I liked how that guy ... I liked the ending, how that guy was playing fetch with the dog. Well, I didn't ... Wait, there's another part in the first ending when he was playing on the TV. I like playing fetch and I like playing on the TV. I didn't like how the dog was messing around while he was playing his game. The mom. The dog. You mean, like ... I don't know what you mean before he ... I don't know what you are saying before. When the movie was starting, he played the game first. The puppy ... The puppy was playing with the ball. Well, I don't know how they are the same. No. Can I watch some of ? Can I watch that one? He was feeling good. The boy was ... The boy was feeling good when that dog was his present. Good. Why did he do that? I don't know why he did ... When he threw him off? Maybe he was nervous. Bad. I think because he smells bad. Or maybe that's why ... Or maybe he doesn't like it. He doesn't like ... Nervous. Maybe sad. He was still mad. Sad. That was sad. How did I like the end.

Yeah, but I never seen like the middle of it. Before when the mom was not there, the boy was playing video games all the time. And when he was not there, she brung in a box and then when you opened the box, there was a dog with three legs in there. And then when he saw he was missing a leg, he said \"Ew\" and then he just threw him on the floor. And then when the dog came close to him, he kicked him. And then when the dog saw the ball, he gave him the ball and then he kicked the ball and then he picked it up and then he told his mom that he was going to go outside. That he started to like him. At the beginning that he didn't like him and then he started to have a personality that he had. When he kicked the dog. The mom. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. They're both missing a leg.

No. In the beginning, the boy wasn't doing anything but playing, and his mom told him to go outside but he didn't want to. And he got a puppy. Yeah. At first, he didn't like the puppy since he had only three legs, but then finally at the end, he stopped playing his game and realized that he needs to go outside. And I noticed that he, his arms are broken, and the dog is missing an arm. It shows how cute the dog was. I didn't like how the boy was ignoring the dog. The mom. A dog. He was playing. A ball. They, something is both gone. The puppy. Excited. Happy. I was like, okay. Sad. Weirded out. I felt sad. Sadder. I don't really know how to describe it. Sadder. Happy. Happy. Happy.","NDARFK610GY5":"Yes. The boy first is playing video games, and then the Mom came in and brought him a dog, and found out that he had no leg, and so he was grumpy at first, but then he liked the dog. He didn't have a leg too. And then, they played fetch. He had to wear crutches, and that's about it. The puppy was pretty cute. Kind of gross, at first, when he found out that it didn't have a leg. His mom. The puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They both were missing a leg. Happy. Kind of happy. I don't know. A little dejected. Grossed out. I don't know. Kind of bored. Anxious to play with the ball. Annoyed. Kind of annoyed. Happy. Happy. I don't know.","NDARJJ343TR0":"No, I haven't seen it before. It was kind of new to me. At first the boy was playing a video game, then his mom came home with a dog in the box, and when he opened the box, the dog had half a leg missing. After that, the boy treated the dog bad because it had no arm, but then after a while, he realized that the dog was like him, because he didn't have a leg and the dog didn't have a leg either. Yeah, I remember he was on crutches and walking outside to play with the dog that he got. I liked the end where he threw the ball, and the middle where he got the dog and the dog was tripping over him, tripping over because he didn't have a leg. I didn't like how the boy was treating the dog bad just because it didn't have a leg. His mom gave him the box because she noticed that he was on the game too much and she wanted him to get off the game for a while. Inside the box was a dog. A dog without a leg at all. The boy was playing on his console before he was given the box. The puppy was playing with a red ball that he found underneath a counter. The puppy and the boy are the same because both of them only have half a leg and yeah, that's it. Both of them were missing a leg, because when the boy got up, he was on crutches, I noticed that he had half a leg gone and the dog had a half a leg gone too. The puppy was feeling excited to have a new owner, because it probably didn't have a owner just because of it's difference in its arm. The boy felt excited for that first part, but then after he noticed the arm gone, he decided to throw it on the floor and kick it. I felt excited at first, but then when he threw the dog down, I felt sad because the dog was like him and he didn't realize it. The puppy was feeling excited because it was feeling happy in the first place because it had an owner, and yeah, just because it had an owner and because of its arm difficulty, he wanted a new owner. The boy was feeling excited at first because he got a dog, but after a while, he realized that the arm was gone when he took it out the box, so he decided to just throw it on the floor and just kick it. I felt very sad because the boy treated the dog wrong and he should have known that the dog was like him, because they both didn't have half a limb. The puppy was feeling sad at that part, because he wanted to play with his new owner, but then the boy kicked him just because of his arm. The boy was feeling very mad because his mom got him the wrong dog because the dog was missing an arm, but then he decided to kick him just because of his arm. I felt mad at the boy because he treated the dog wrong just because he didn't have an arm. The puppy was feeling happy because his owner actually got up and played with him at the end. The boy was feeling happy because the puppy found the ball and the boy thought that the dog was fine because it was tripping over the ball. I felt happy because the owner and the dog got along just because of the differences in the limbs.","NDARMM326JCB":"No. The boy was playing video games, and then his mom came home with a package. She put it down and so the boy opened it, and it was a dog with three legs instead of four. So, he put the dog down and just went back to playing, then the dog brought him a ball and he kicked it away. And then the dog, he watched the dog struggle to try to get in and then he thought it was fun, so then he got his crutches and went outside, and he only had one leg. So, that's it, and they started playing catch. Not really. That the boy and the dog were similar. It was kind of shocking at the end that the boy had one leg instead of two. That the boy first neglected the dog, and that's it. His mother. The dog. Playing video games. The ball. They are each missing one leg. Excited and happy. Happy. Kind of happy. At first ... oh wait, I was happy. Sad. Mad. I felt sorry for the dog. Still sad. I think the boy was still sad, too. Still sorry for the puppy. Very happy. Happy, too. Happier.","NDARWG798MJG":"I have not. So there is a boy that was playing video games at his house, and his mom came in, and the boy was not really paying attention to her and kind of annoying her. And she dropped this box down. And he kind of just let it sit there for a few minutes, and then he opened it up, and there was a puppy inside. And he was really happy and wowed for a moment. And then he realized that the puppy only had three legs, and he was angry and depressed kind of, and he kind of kicked it and dropped it away.                     Then the puppy kept trying to play with him, and was just doing very childish things, and he started kind of growing on the boy. And there was this red ball that the puppy was going for, and he tried to get it and he tried to get the boy to throw it for him. So the boy started trying to throw it to him, and the boy was like, \"All right, I should take you outside. This isn't enough room.\" So he gets up, and the big reveal is that he also is missing a leg.\n I mean like vivid, not ... I mean like they go outside in the end, nothing really. I thought the twist was really good at the end, and I thought it was heart-wrenching and just well-animated. I thought it was great. I mean there's things like I would dislike, but nothing that wasn't intentional. His mom, I'm guessing. A puppy. Playing video games. A red ball. They both were missing a leg. Both. Excited and very happy probably to be out of the box and see someone new. Really happy and really excited, cause he's probably wanted a puppy. I thought it was really awesome, like oh this is really cool, cause I thought it would be some kind of twist until like kids getting outside. I think the puppy didn't really ... wasn't defeated, was a little sad that he threw him, but I don't think he was too angry, and was still in a very happy mood. Angry that it had three legs. I thought the kid was kind of a douche bag, to say the truth, and was just kind of someone I don't wanna be friends with, or someone that really reads a book by its cover. I think the puppy was more defeated, but still was kind of in a mood like, all right, this is fine. I'm okay with this. I'm just gonna keep trying and be myself. Even more angry, sort of kicked him back, and he's like, all right, I just wanna play my video games, ignore this thing. A little bit more depressed, same feelings, just up a little bit more. Very happy, excited, and probably a little bit like, \"I'm finally outside, and this is what I thought was gonna happen in the beginning.\" More excited, and more accepting, more ... I was very like, whoa, I did not expect that coming for the twist at the end, and also just happy. And I thought it was a good ending when I saw the ending.","NDARZJ016GL0":"The last one? Like the small one? No. So, first, there was a boy and he was playing video games. Then his mom came home and she put a box on the coffee table, and then he was still focused on his video game. And then she got a call, or she went to the kitchen first, then she got a call, and she went upstairs, and then he looked inside the box. And then a puppy jumped out and then he thought it was cute at first, but then when he saw it didn't have a leg, then he didn't like him, which was mean.                     Then, the puppy saw a ball and he took the ball and then started playing with it. Then he gave the ball to the boy, and the boy went outside and he, actually also, was missing one of his legs. So then, him and the boy, he told his mom he was going to be outside and then they played fetch.\n No. At the end, when they got along. When the boy liked him, liked the dog. That he was addicted to video games and that he didn't like the dog because he lost one of his legs. The mom. The puppy. Playing video games. A red ball. They both lost a leg. Mm-hmm (affirmative). Excited. Excited, too. Happy, I guess. Sad, I guess. Disgusted. Disappointed. Like I forgot the word for it, but it's ... I don't know, like ... I forgot the word. But, I guess, like the boy no, he was sad, I guess. Disgusted. Mad, I guess, too. Happy. Happy, too. Happy.","NDARZJ460RWZ":"No. I heard about it though. Telling me, can you tell me what happened to would be try to tell the whole story. Remember, stories have a beginning and ending. Things that happened and an ending.                     All right. So I know what it's about, it's about this boy got a dog, and dog with one leg, like one leg missing. And I kinda realize, and then when he stands up at the park I realized that he was missing a leg too, so they kinda got similarities. And the present was a dog in a box. So he was like starting off him playing with his Xbox, I memorized the controller because I have one. So, and then it was just, there was stuff for coming, he opens his box, the dog's in it, the dog's missing one leg, and so they go out on the park and then he plays some sort of like fetch, and he throws the ball, and it was kinda funny the dog went like running and then tripping, and then running and tripping. I mean I wouldn't blame him for only having three legs, but it was like he had to hop and one leg's like this, a cane. I don't know how that happened. \n Hmm, it's dog was like a yellowish, beige kinda like this. Yeah. I thought it was really cute about that the dog and the boy having similarities because you don't usually see a kid like that, with all this missing in his knee up here. And the dog was really cute, I almost like ... I don't know, it was really cute and it was a really good movie when I saw a little bit of it. I couldn't really say anything else, because I thought it was a pretty good movie so far. I really thought it was, I don't really think about anything else. His mom. Dog. Playing the Xbox. Ball. They're both missing a leg. All right. That guy was not in the tube. Happy. Happy, until he realizes the leg is missing in the movie. But he still liked him. The dog really made me feel adorable, it was so adorable I thought. Real. Why is it pausing? Happy, like he was enjoying. Maybe somewhat now, like somewhat happy, somewhat like , I remember when the dog went like ugh, his leg was missing. But remember he, his leg's missing too. I still thought the dog was adorable. I really do, I just can't stop thinking about the dog, it was just adorable. Look it's the Xbox controller. Maybe wanting to play maybe, cause he kept coming to him? He was just like focusing on the game like just on Xbox nonstop. He wasn't really looking at the dog or playing with it. If I got a dog, I wanted a dog since I was like four or three. If I got one I would of jumped and I would of like jumped , I would have been so excited I tell you. Even if it was missing a leg I would still be happy. I do feel like watch the clip.                     I feel like the, I felt kinda, I feel like happy, number one cause the guy got a dog, I mean who can say that? The dog with the missing leg. I mean like, it's like who cares if it's a missing leg, I mean he's still alive, he's still adorable ... and the boy was getting confused and then I realized, then I think he realized that he was missing a leg, and then you're trying again, trying to get along. \n Look, see what I mean? How does the dog run like that? Cause look, he's playing fetch. Happy, because he could play fetch at the end. Happy, I felt like that. At least somewhat ... interesting and wondering of some sort.                     How did you feel when you watched the clip, did we do that already?\n I don't know, I feel like this was all I could say that this was a really good clip of the movie definitely.","NDARGF367KVL":"I've not. So, this kid was playing video games, he got a dog who did not have a leg from his mom. He kinda like shook him off and towards the end of it we find out that he also doesn't have a leg. I found that ironic there. They played ball and the dog had trouble walking and stuff. I liked how they ended up liking each other at the end, I think. And the dog was really cute and it was pretty ironic at the beginning. How the person without ... how he kinda pushed the dog off and stuff. I didn't like that at first but then I found out he also doesn't have a leg but still he shouldn't be pushing the dog off. I don't know. The mom. The dog. He was playing video games. The ball. They both didn't have a leg, a limb? They were both missing a leg, yeah. Excited for the new owner. He at first liked the dog. I felt like happy. Pretty down but I think he kinda ignored it afterwards. The boy felt really annoyed too. Kinda mad. Squealed at first but he kinda brushed that off too. He was forgiving. Still mad and ungrateful. Mad again like how the boy was so ungrateful for what he got. Happy. They were both feeling happy that they both could relate. Happy for them both.","NDARBM839WR5":"No. I didn't really enjoy it, I ... Well, it starts out with this boy. He's playing video games. And then his mom comes in and gives him a box. In the box is a puppy with three legs. And then he's annoyed by it. And eventually he's like, \"Okay, I'll, I'll ... \" and it turns out he lost half his leg. And that's basically all I saw. That's really all I remember. So- I don't like or dislike anything. It was really just meh. I don't, I already told you. I really didn't like or dislike anything. It was really just meh. His mom. A 3-legged puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They both lost half a leg. Nice. I guess a little . I was just like, \"Meh, meh, meh, meh\". Bad. A little . Yeah. Again, meh. I was pretty much meh throughout the whole movie. Puppy felt bad. Boy felt angry. I was pretty much meh throughout the whole entire movie. Good. Good.

Then he was drinking Lay's potato chips, eating Lay's potato chips and the puppy went ... there was a red ball underneath the cabinet so the puppy bumped his head. So he went to get the ball and he shaked. Then the boy realized that he loves puppies. The boy called to his mom that ... got his crutches and told mom that they'd be outside and went to go play outside with the puppy. And that's the end of the three minute movie. I don't know. I liked it when teenage boys like me, like play video games. I know I didn't like when the boy told the dog to get lost, when the boy told the dog to get lost. The mom. A puppy. He was playing video games. A ball. Am I done? They're humans. Neither. Either. All right. Does it tell the whole story? Happy and playful. Surprised. I liked it. I liked the whole movie.  He knocked the box off the table. Upset. Upset because he doesn't like puppies. I liked it.  Oh. Dropped something. Upset. Careless. I don't know. Remember, stories have beginnings, middles and ends. Got it. So I think he has a injury, a severe, a fatal injury. A severe injury, I think. He does. The name of the ... the title was \"The Present.\" Happy that the boy wanted to play with the puppy.

And when he opened it, there was a dog inside. And at first, he was like, \"Oh my god. It's so cool.\" And then when it stated barking, he threw it on the floor and said, \"Get lost.\" And then it ran back to him and he kicked it away. And it started barking happily and then it saw the ball, and it grabbed the ball and then gave it to the boy who was so mad, he just kicked it away. And then the ball ... And the dog thought it was playing fetch so it grabbed the ball and gave it back to the boy who threw it. And then, the dog got it, gave it back to him. And the kid stopped playing the video game. He told his mum he'll be outside. He went outside with the dog and he started playing fetch. No. Well, I didn't really get to see a lot of stuff from it, the movie, so I don't really know. But I would think that the main two characters from the movie are the boy and the dog. I just liked when in the beginning, when he was like, \"Oh my god. That's so cool.\" But then he hated the dog, and then he looked at it one more time and decided that it looked cute and stuff like that. Well, when he threw the dog on the floor and he didn't really look at it so much. The mum. The dog. He was playing video game. The ball. They both like to play with different things. I think it's the boy. Okay. The puppy felt really happy. He was like, \"Oh my god.\" Excited. Well, I was just surprised that there was a dog inside because you would hear the dog barking. So I was just surprised that there was a dog. A little bit sad when he threw him but then, he got right back up and started bugging the boy again. Annoyed. Well, I was just ... Well, if I could get a dog, I wouldn't throw it on the ground or ... He was excited to be with the boy, but then he realized that the boy didn't really like him so he just saw the ball and he ran to the ball instead. Really annoyed. Wished his mum didn't get the dog. Well, if that happened to me, I don't know what I'll do. I'll just pick up the dog and put it back in the box or something like that. Okay. Happy that the boy was starting to play with him. A little better that he doesn't have to shout at the dog and throw it. Well, it was a movie so I didn't exactly care. But I think the dog felt better and the boy.","NDARAC904DMU":"No. There was a kid who all he did was play video games and his mom brought in a box with a dog in it that didn't have a leg and he thought it was disgusting and he just threw it on the floor. And he didn't really care about it and then he realized that the dog was tripping and kept getting stuck. And then he walked outside with the dog and then he didn't have a leg so he started playing with the dog. No. I liked how his emotions changed from the beginning to the end of the movie because first he started out really he didn't want the dog at all, he thought it was stupid and disgusting, and then towards the end he really, really liked it. I didn't like how in the beginning he was being so mean to the dog because I personally love dogs so much and I never want anyone to ever hurt them. His mother. A dog with no leg. He was playing video games. A red ball that he found under a dresser. They both don't have a leg or a body part or something. Loved because someone was actually being nice to him and caring about him. Happy that he got a new pet or something. I thought that I was really nice because I liked how he was being really nice to the dog. Hated because he just threw him on the floor because he didn't have a leg. Angry because he thought he was getting a real dog with all four of his legs and then he only had three. I felt like really angry because I didn't want anyone hurting any type of animal. He seemed kind of happy but I think he realized that nobody was really being nice to him so I think he was feeling a little hated. Angry that the dog wouldn't stop annoying him, or annoyed. I felt the same as before, I did not feel good because I love animals and I don't want anybody hurting any animals. I think he was finally feeling like he related to someone or something because he knew that someone else knew what it felt like to not have a leg or a body part. I think he started to get used to the dog and started really liking it and being really happy. I felt really happy because he finally really liked the dog and he related to him.","NDARJA157YB3":"I hope you enjoyed that last movie. Have you seen it before?

And then the boy got up, put the ball in his pocket, and he went outside and he told his mom. And him and the dog were going to play together. That also he didn't have his leg. That they both didn't have a leg and they were similar, and - That in the beginning, he didn't play with the dog, with - I would have played with the dog, since I noticed - I had a pet dog. His mom. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. In the box. They both don't have an arm or a leg. What? Here? Yeah, he likes - he opens the box. Yeah. And pausing it. Whoa, cool! Like, he didn't notice he didn't have - Very, very happy. Excited and happy. Happy, also. Why's it - Happy, and then a little upset. Grossed out. Sad. Sad. Very upset. More upset, then. The boy kicked him. Happy and sad, because he hurt a dog. Upset. - hear the words. Happy. Happy. Happy.","NDAREV601CE7":"No, not really! I didn't even see trailers of it! What day did it come out? So this kid that I don't ... That had two legs ... He had ... His mom bought him ... He was playing video games and his mom bought him a dog. That dog only had three legs ... And one of his legs is gone so the kid that I thought had two legs only had one leg. They were both disabled. He didn't know ... He didn't want to play with the dog at first until the dog started playing around with the red ball. Then the dog got stuck in the box, then he got himself out. Then the kid noticed and he told his mom he was going outside to play with the dog. So then he played catch with the dog. I saw an Xbox 360 controller. He was playing a video game. I don't know that video game. I know a lot of video game sounds. How the disabled boy meets a disabled dog. I guess it would be the disabled dog. Not that much because  I was ... I didn't even know like ... The minute I noticed it, I was like \"Wow! What's wrong with that dog?\" I'm tying my shoes. The mother. The disabled dog. Yeah. He was playing video games. His puppy was playing with the ball. The red ball. Isn't that the same clip? You can see the disabled dog without his arm. The puppy was feeling excited that he got to see his new owner. He was excited at first until he saw the disabled  like, \"What's wrong with that dog?\" I noticed it the minute ... The second I saw him open the box, like you could ... Show the movie again.  Like if you could see from the computer, you could see the disabled dog without his leg. I was shocked! About that movie or about another one? Yeah, you can clearly see that ... You can clearly see that that ... That he was trying to push the ... That he pushed the dog away because he noticed that he only had three legs. He was so excited. He was disgusted. I felt surprised and disgusted at the same time. You can see the 360 controller right there. The puppy was  that he hated him. That the owner kid hated him so he kept trying and trying to get him to play with him. No. No. No. Didn't want to play. I just started blankly. The last clip. The last ... Ending of ... The Present. The puppy was feeling so excited that his owner finally noticed him. The boy was happy because he felt like a connection between both of them since they're alike. I felt like I was going to cry. Because that is just so sad! The fact that those two are disabled. Both of them! It symbolize them!","NDARWJ621JRZ":"No. Okay. A boy was playing video games, and then his mom came with a box. He kept on playing video games for a long time, and then he finally opened the box while the mom was on her phone walking upstairs. Then there was a dog with three legs, he didn't have one leg. He was walking around and the boy kept on kicking the dog, putting the dog away. Then he through the ball at the dog and he thought the dog was kind of funny so he went outside with the dog, and he had one leg too. Then he threw the ball and the dog was playing. Not really. That the boy and the dog were the same kind of thing. They both had a leg off. Nothing. The mom. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. They have one leg off. Both. Happy. Excited. Good. Mad. Mad. Not so good. Sad. Annoyed. It was bad. Happy. Happy. Good because they got along.","NDARAV519RND":"Not really that much though, so not really the best time. Yeah, one time. In the movie, a kid was playing a video game and then his mom came and told him she got a present for him. So after, he opened it, and then he saw a dog and the dog had three arms and three hands ... No, no four arms but three hands because one of his arms didn't have a hand, I think it was. And then he got mad for some reason. And then he just dropped the dog. I don't know why. And then he just continued playing video games and then the dog saw a ball, a red ball, under a table. So then he tried to get it and then he got it. And then he tried to give the ball to his owner, the kid. And then he kept on falling since he didn't have all of his hands or arms, I think. I don't know. And then after three falls, he finally gets there and then the kid decided to play with him. And then they went either outside in the backyard, maybe? I don't know. And then he threw the ball and the dog got it and that was it. Okay. The kid was kind of like the dog since he didn't have his full leg, or something like that. I don't know why. Not really anything. The whole thing itself. I kind of thought it was boring. Then again, it's supposed to be a bit short. A bit short. His mom. I do not think it was a Pug. A dog of some sort. Playing a video game. The red ball that was under the table. The puppy doesn't have a full leg and the boy doesn't have a full leg. Both. What? What kind of clip is that? No, no I meant why did it look like there were cubes? Pretty happy. Pretty happy. Probably a bit sad for a couple of seconds until he saw the red ball. And then he was pretty happy again. Pretty sad, maybe mad. Or maybe both. Probably a bit sad for a second. And then he tries to get the ball I think now? I told you. Probably a bit sad for a couple of seconds because then he looks like he's happy when he finds the ball. Probably mad. The same. A bit tired. That's what he said! Looks like he had a pet giraffe before. Happy and the boy was feeling happy too. The same, tired.","NDARHR372GJ7":"Yeah, I actually saw it on YouTube once. The mom brought a dog that didn't have a leg and the kid didn't have a leg. At first, the kid was ignoring the dog, but then he started to like him. Not really. The last one? That he started to like the dog after he hated him. It was kind of short. It could have been longer. His mom. The dog. He was playing his video game. A ball. 'Cause they both don't have a leg. They both were. Happy. Happy. Happy. Disappointed. Angry. Disappointed. He was still feeling happy, because he just wanted to get his attention. He didn't want to be bothered. It felt weird, because he just started to like him. Now, and just started being- . Happy. The same. The same.","NDARPW577WJ7":"Yes. I really didn't see what really happened just because he played one part of this movie and he played it in another ... Oh. I don't ... It was ... No. Not that one. the whole beginning. I didn't see full ... No I didn't see the full movie because he played it at the very end. Oh, okay. So it was about a kid who had one leg and the mom got him a puppy that was missing one foot. And at first he didn't like it and then he played with it and he liked it. He was happy. And that's how ... That's it. No, no. I don't really know because it's short. It was a short movie. I don't really know because it was so short. His mom. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. They're both missing a limb. Mm-hmm (affirmative). Happy. Happy too. I don't really know. I think happy still. A little angry. I don't know really. A little upset probably. Angry still. It's had to think because it's so short. So I don't really know. Happy. Happy. It's so hard to think because it's so short, so it's ... I don't really know.","NDARUN300FG1":"No. The last one? The kid was playing a game, but then the mom gave him a gift, which is a dog. And then the dog wanted to play with a ball. Okay. No, I don't know. The dog was playing the ball and the kid was playing his game. I don't remember. Yes. The mom did. A dog. Giving the dogs. Playing his game. A ball. Some of their body parts are like lost. Happy. Happy too. Happy. After when he that, he was so happy, he wanted to play so ... Disgust. A little bit disgust too, but ... Still happy after that clip. He's still. Disgust too. Well, I'm surprised how he can still stand with one arm. Happy. Happy too. Happy.","NDARWB457JU6":"No. The mom got a dog, brought home a dog from her work. She gave it to the kid. The kid didn't like it, and he pushed it around. He kept pushing it around. Then he kept going to get the ball. Then he kicked the ball, and it went in a box. He tumbled over in the box, and he started walking in the box. They both had missing legs. They went outside, and they had fetch. No. The video game. That they were missing legs. The mom. A dog. Playing video games. The ball. They're both missing legs. Both. Good. Good. Good. Bad. Mad. Okay. Mad. Mad. Good. Good. Good. Sad.","NDARKY667THK":"I think I have. Yeah, actually. Okay, so there was a boy playing video games and it seemed like he never stopped playing video games and the mom came home with, I think she said it was a coffee machine or something. I can't- I couldn't really hear well, but she was like, \"Okay, open the box, open the box,\" and he did and there was a dog and he was really excited. And then he picked up the dog and saw that it was missing a leg and kind of pushed it aside and was really rude towards it. And the dog was super happy, brought a ball to him, and then the boy finally kind of gave in and they both went outside. That's kind of it. Well, it was really sweet and meaningful, because obviously the boy was having a hard time because he was missing a leg. And then he was able to create a bond with the dog. I guess the beginning was kind of sad. I mean, it was hard to watch the beginning. The mom. A dog. Playing video games. A red ball. They're both missing a leg or a paw or whatever. Okay. Excited and happy, at that point. He was also excited and happy. Good, like the boy finally found someone. Well, before he knew that- yeah. Sad, I guess. Annoyed that his mom gave him a dog without a leg. Really sad and disappointed, I guess. Still sad. Still annoyed and frustrated and stuff, I guess. Same, just like disappointed, frustrated at the kid. Super happy and satisfied, I guess. Really happy and like he had a companion now. I felt really happy, but... I don't know, you know, just happy. Excited to see them together. Okay.","NDARGD507TDZ":"No. In the beginning, there was a boy playing video games, then the mom bought in a box fr him. He opened it up and then there was a dog in there and then he went to play with the dog outside. I remember that he had one leg, had a broken leg. The dog when he was in the box and when he wants to play outside. Him kicking the dog. The mom. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. That's a hard question. Sometimes, I have this in a test, like a math test, how is it the same? Because they like each other? Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad. Mad. Sad cause he kicked the dog. Sad. Mad again. Sad.                     Can't believe he has one leg.\n Happy. Happy. Happy.","NDARBU730PN8":"No. So, there was a boy, who was, like, obsessed with his video games. Then his mom came home one day, and she put a box on the table. He opened it, and there was a dog in it. He saw that the dog was missing a leg. The dog started doing funny things. He finally decided to throw the ball to the dog. Then he went out ... Then he stood up, and he went to the door to go outside with the dog. That's when I realized that the boy also had ... realized that he was so upset that the dog had one too. No. I like the ending. It was good to see that he liked the dog. Usually people won't like something cause it's not perfect, so. I'd like it to be longer so I just know what happened after. The boy's mother. A dog. He was playing video games. A ball. They're both missing, like, a leg, or him ... It was excited. He was also excited. I don't know. It was like ... It was kinda surprising that it popped out. And I was like ... I don't know. Like a little bit upset that he was pushed on the floor. He was mad that he saw that the dog had the same thing as him. A little bit sad that they both had a disability. A little bit determined. He was trying to make the boy like him and have fun, even though he was being pushed. He was mad that ... He was still mad about the dog. I felt bad for the dog that he was being kicked around. Happy that the boy had the same thing as him, so he finally had someone else. Happy that he also had someone else, or something else that had the same thing. Happy that they both got along finally.","NDAREF893ZM8":"Mm-hmm (affirmative). I have. Okay. So what happened was ... there was this criminal. His name's Gru and he wanted to be... Oh. So what happened was there was this boy and he was like, playing video games and he, like, didn't want to go outside. Then he found ... and then he like, his mom got him for a present ... he got a dog that only had three legs and then, at first he wasn't interested in the dog, and then eventually he got up and I realized that he only had one leg. So then he went outside and then he started playing with the dog. That's really it. Well, it's probably like, a lot of kids have actually had that happen to them, where like, they're playing video games all the time and they go outside and then eventually they get a pet and then they finally go outside. Well, I didn't like that it was short. I wish that it was longer. That's really it. His mom. A three-legged dog. Playing a violent video game. A ball. A red ball. They are, they both are missing one leg. And yeah. The puppy is probably happy to see the kid. At first interested, but then not really. I felt happy. Sad. Angry. Kind of disgusted. Like sad, and like rejected. Angry. Once again, like disgusted. Probably happy. Happy as well. Happy. Yeah.","NDARPW786GC4":"The puppy interview? Yeah. I saw it, like a couple of time. Like, my mom was on Facebook or something, and she saw this very cute puppy video, so she showed it to me. So, it was about this boy playing video games, and his mom gave her a puppy that was in an accident, or was born with something wrong with it. And, it only had three legs, because it lost its fourth leg. And, the boy didn't want a puppy that was weird. But, then at the end of the video, it showed that the boy lost his leg, too, probably in an accident, or like, he was born like that. The puppy wanted to play with him. But he didn't. That it's okay to be yourself. To tell you truth, that'd be like the lost body parts or something. The mom. A puppy with three legs, only. Playing video games, like, Call of Duty, or something. A ball. Because they both lost a leg. Both. Happy. Well, at first he was happy until he- Happy. That they thought that he was gonna accept the puppy through the whole entire video. . A little bit sad. Disappointed. I would say animal cruelty, like, animal abuse, because you don't just throw a puppy, that's abusive. Kinda positive to get the boy to look at him. Angry and disappointed. That I think he's still doing a bit of abusing, because he's, like, kicking the puppy, and you're not supposed to do that. Happy. Proud. I feel, like a bit proud, because the boy was proud that someone else is like him.","NDARLP624GFH":"I forgot Forgot. Forgot. Forgot. Forgot. Forgot Forgot. A ball.  Good Huh? Good. Good.  Good. Good.

He opened up the box and saw a puppy inside and when he picked it up he saw that it was missing one leg. So, when he put it down, he actually threw it down because he was annoyed with it. Um, and then when it wanted his attention he kicked it to the side. Um, then he threw a ball for it and he got, um, he smiled as it, um, as it tripped like over the ball and ran back to him. Um, and eventually after ... After doing that for a little bit he, um, stopped playing with the video game. Um, stood up and he grabbed his ... Arm supports, I think? Things that helped him walk, because he had one of his legs amputated from the knee down. So then he went outside to play with the dog. Um, no ... Yeah, no.

So a little boy was playing his video games, and his mother brought in a present for him, came home from I would be guessing workplace, and brought a present. It was a dog with it's left front leg missing. The boy kind of shunned it away a little bit, avoided it, until I guess found this place with the dog, and a relationship. It even shows the boy had a leg missing, too, his left leg. From the end, they went outside and they were playing with each other. No. No. It was pretty emotional. Yeah. I don't really like anything about it. His mother. A dog. Was playing video games. Hmm? A ball. They both legs missing. Hmm? Both. Okay. Happy. Happy. I felt the same way when I got my first dog. I was pretty happy, excited. Wouldn't really know. Upset. Almost disgusted. Well, the puppy, most of the time, he felt joyful and wanting to play with the boy.

He keep on going to him, and then he got up, and then he just went outside. Oh, I can remember one. The dog was chasing him when he was about to go out the door. I liked when he opened the box and he saw the doggie, because I like doggies, too. The stuff that I didn't like about the movie is when the puppy chases him out the door. Mom. A doggie. Playing games and stuff. He didn't play anything, I think. He just dropped and then he went back to him and then he keep on kicking him. I don't like him. Because, because ... I don't know how they are the same. Who was missing a leg? Neither. I really don't remember. Very, very happy. Happy. Excited. He was feeling sad. He was feeling, he was feeling mad.

Which one? Wait, what's the question? What's the question? Oh well, a kid, he got a dog with one leg. And he was like disappointed and didn't want it, because it was like disabled. And it started wanting to play with him, and he kept like banging the stuff, and eventually he felt bad. So, he decided to start playing with him, and turns out he also had one leg, too. So ... I guess that's what happened. No. It was like pretty short. Like, wasn't it five minutes? What I liked? ... I guess I like the dog. Because he was like ... I don't know, just like a little ... I didn't really like the kid that much, cause he was like rejecting the dog, and he was like being kinda mean to it. So I didn't like that. His mom. The dog. He was playing video games. A ball. Well they both are missing a body part. Okay. I think he was feeling happy, because he's finally out of the box. And he has like a family. Well he was happy too, when he saw the dog. I guess kinda happy. Well, like sad because he just threw him on the floor, so ... He was kinda angry, because the dog is missing a leg. A little bit angry, cause he just threw a dog on the floor, so ... I guess still sad, cause he just got kicked. He's getting annoyed at the dog. Kinda like angry at the kid, cause he kicked the dog, and yeah ... Happy cause he's finally playing with him? I guess he's finally like ... He kinda like feels bad for the dog because like they're both missing a body part, and he can like kinda relate. So ... Pity I guess? I was like kinda surprised, cause I didn't know he was missing a leg, and I guess happy for them.","NDARJF579EH9":"Yes. So in the beginning the kid was playing video games and his mom came home with a box, and then she tried to get his attention for him to open up her gift that she was giving to him and then he opened it. He finally paused his game and he opened up the box and he saw a puppy, so he was shocked about it because it seemed that he wasn't expecting one, but then he pulled the puppy out and saw that it only had three legs. He was disgusted by that so then he just threw the puppy to the side, but it seemed that the puppy was already used to having three legs so then he was fine with it and he just kept playing. Every time he fell, he would get back up. Then the boy started seeing that and finding it actually nice and funny. So then the puppy was playing catch with the ball.                     Then I think the puppy gave courage to the little boy and he got it up and then it showed that the boy also only had one leg and he was on crutches so it seems like his mom got him a puppy that related to him to show him that it shouldn't be something that you just ... that you shouldn't be ashamed of. The puppy got him out of the house where it was like in the beginning it seemed that the boy just sat home and played video games all day.\n I remember that the mom was on the phone and then it kind of seemed ... originally when I had first seen I didn't never noticed this, but the second time around it looked like the mom was limping up the stairs too. I don't know if that was part of it but ... I liked how the puppy showed the boy that he can't just quickly give up, so it gave him courage and I liked that. I think I ... I liked pretty much a lot of it. Maybe that the mom wasn't really there, didn't really see his reaction at first and see how it brought him up afterward. Maybe if she was there it would have been a little bit different. The mom. A three-legged puppy. Playing video games. A red ball. The puppy is missing a leg and so is the boy. Both. The puppy seemed happy that he was having an owner maybe. The boy was like, \"Oh, wow. Cool. That's nice.\" I felt happy for him. Probably sad. Angry and also sad. I think the boy was showing that he under-appreciates his mom because it seems like his mom went out of the way to get a puppy that was also missing a leg, so then he was like, \"Oh, she's got to be kidding me.\" It was kind of like, \"Come on.\" Disappointed. Disgusted. Kind of sad. Happy. Happy. Happy.","NDARTF133LLM":"Yes. So, there was this boy that lost his leg, then his mom came home with a surprise and then she left the surprise on the table. She said it was for him.                     He stopped playing video games, he opened the box, it was a dog. The dog had a broken leg too. He didn't like it so, he just threw him off the table. Then, the dog saw this red ball. He started taking it and started giving it to him but the boy didn't want to play with him so he threw it and the dog got it. Then, he lost it, then the guy laughed, the boy laughed but he tried to not to, so then, he actually liked the dog, so he took the ball and the dog and him went outside.\n One thing I liked about that movie was that the boy didn't want to like the dog but didn't want him to know that he didn't like the dog. That I did not like about that movie that the boy was being mean. The mom. A dog. He was playing video games. The ball. They both have two broke...one broken leg. Happy. Sad. Well happy. Happy. Sad. Mad. Normal. He was feeling hurt and the boy was feeling mad. Normal. He was feeling happy. Happy. Happy.","NDARHU211PYD":"Yup.  Oh. He played a game. Then his mother came home. Then he opened his present. Then it was like a lost puppy with three legs. That's how ... So he got outside and threw the ball. Okay. Nah.  the rest of it. I liked it. Despicable Me. It was so good. He turned his leg into a balloon. No. Like he had a lost leg, but then what happens when the lost leg comes back. The boy wrapped up his leg. The mom. A puppy. He was open it. Playing video game. The ball. Because he had the legs. Okay. Happy. Happy. Happy. I'm done. That was my last one. Bad. Bad, didn't want the puppy. Happy. Yeah. He rolled over. I feel happy. Sad. Angry. Sad. No, no.
