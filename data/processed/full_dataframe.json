{"speech":{"NDARYF135ZHU":"No. It's about a boy who plays video games a lot and his mom got him a new dog. They both lost a leg and he begins to like the dog. Okay. No. I don't know. What are some- I was kind of medium. His mom. A dog. Playing video games. A wet ball. They both lost a leg. Okay. How do you think the puppy was feeling?                     Happy. Depressed. I don't know. \n Happy. Happy. I don't know. Ashamed. Yeah. Mad. I don't know. Not so well. Very mad at that point. I don't know either. Happy. Good. I didn't know either.","NDARZY668NMV":"No. Well I don't know who  got all of it of course. But what I did see, I saw, but I didn't know the kid had a ... he had one whole leg, and half of the other, and he had to use crutches. But I didn't know that at first, I thought he was just sitting down playing video games. Then the dog had the same thing, he had three, he has ... A dog that supposed to have four legs, but he only has three. And when he walks, he kind of stops, rolls over a little bit cause he only has three and a half basically. And not the whole, and not four whole legs. So they're just like each other.                     The boy didn't want to play with it, didn't want to play with him. Then he realized that he had the same problem that he had, so then they went outside and played fetch. \n I remember that the mom brung the box down to Ted like is this for you? Then went upstairs. And the box had the dog in it. I liked that there was a dog included, cause I like dogs a lot. I like that the dog had the same disability that the boy had. So they both were in the same boat basically. Some of the things that I didn't like about the movie was when the boy didn't know that he had the same disability that he had, he kept kicking the dog over, and he kept ... He kicked the dog and that's not good. You shouldn't kick the dog even though you don't like it. So that's the part that I didn't really like. The mom gave the box to the boy. The dog. Playing video games. The ball. They both have, they both have one leg that's cut or that they don't have the paw, and they don't have the foot. They both have that basically the same. Excited, and happy. The boy said cool, so I feel like he felt like it was cool basically and he was happy and excited. I felt happy for the both of them. Basically he has a pet now, and they both before he didn't have anyone that's the same as him, and now he does. So now they have a happy. That the puppy felt sad I think, when he knocked him over. Mad, angry, upset. I felt sad that the boy knocked the dog over. Sad. How he tried again to play and all that, then he just kicked him over said, \"Get lost.\" Aggravated, and annoyed. I felt like the dog was trying to work with him. But stay with him even though he knocked him over again. Knocked him over for and I feel  and I feel like the boy should have played with him before then. Excited and happy that the boy finally wanted to play with him. The boy was feeling like, happy I'd say. Happy and bled happy. He's feeling happy. I felt like, I felt happy watching this clip cause the boy actually wants to play with the dog. And that's good, so I felt happy.","NDARKA331XEL":"No, this is my first time. There was this boy who got a puppy with only three legs. One of its legs was missing. And then he was playing video games and that he shoved the dog off, and then he thought the dog was funny. And then he went outside to play with the dog, and I was shocked that he was like the dog. He was missing a leg. It was kind of sad. That he finally played with the dog. That he kept on shoving him away. His mother. A three-legged puppy. Playing video games. The red ball. Because they were both missing one leg. Both. Happy. Really happy. Excited. Heartwarming, heartwarming. Right now? Sad and neglected. Angry. Angry. When he got shoved? Sad. Still angry. Sad. the clip we just watched. Happy. Happy. Heart warmed.","NDARPH844KP2":"No. What's that? No. I don't know the middle, or the end. I remember that at first he was playing a video game, and then her Mom said something. I don't remember. It was something like .                     It's not what happens in the movie, but that's the noisiness from the MRI thingy?\n Her Mom, like, put a box there, and when she opened it, it was like  a dog that came out. And then, dog landed on the floor, and I think he did something, like, he licked him the first time, or something, but then like he, like went on his leg, or something, I mean like went like that, and he's like get off, and that happened like a few times, or something happened, and he's like get off, or he's like . And then, like, soon after that, he got up, and we figured out that half of his leg is missing, I think. Like, or his ear, some of it. And then, he like had these things, and he went outside, and he threw the ball a little bit. That's what I remember. I don't think so. Well, I thought it was cool to be about that dog, and then ... I knew that. It was just a ball that he, like, threw sometimes, a little bit, and the dog tried to get it. Well, is there supposed ... I don't know the movie, like, you stopped it at the beginning. Like, I don't know the whole movie so like ... That was? No, that was the end of the movie, when I saw that. I like that story. Yeah. No. I just don't feel like that boy was so nice to the dog. The mom. The dog. Playing video games. The ball. They both like to play something else. Happy. Happy too. I don't know. Can we watch it again? I wasn't really focusing. I feel like he's happy. Happy too. Happy. I'm not supposed to feel anything. I don't get it, like, how do you feel happy?                     Like, you feel happy, yeah, you're happy, but from watching a movie? Like, it can sometimes make you happy, but like it's not like the happy, happy, kind of happy. It makes you feel like ... Aww. That's sweet. That kind of happy.\n Okay. Sad, a little bit, when he dropped him off. Ewww. That's disgusting. I feel like the boy wasn't being nice. Sad. Like, get off of me. Why are you bothering me? I feel like the boy wasn't being nice. Happy. Like, it was a good puppy, or happy too. I was feeling like the boy's a good boy, a little bit.","NDARAY461TZZ":"Yeah. The kid was sitting on his couch playing video games and then his mom gave him a dog, but the dog was missing a leg so at first he didn't like it. And then he noticed that it was acting like every other dog. So, he started to like it. And then he went outside to play with it. When he stood up, he was missing a leg too. So yeah. I guess it was ... it wasn't a city because the house seemed like pretty big and he definitely had a backyard so it didn't really seem like it was in a city. I guess ... I don't know. I liked it, I just don't know exactly what I liked about it. I just liked it. I guess like the animations were cool, I guess. I don't really not like anything about it. It was pretty cool. His mom. A dog. Playing video games. A red ball. They were both missing a leg. Both. Happy. Happy. I guess interested because like it was the very beginning so I didn't know what was going to happen. I guess happy and like sad because like he got thrown on the floor. Mad. I was still interested because I still didn't really know how it was going to like end up. He was kind of like excited but like yeah because it still seemed pretty happy. Still mad. Mad at the boy because he just kicked the dog. Happy. Happy. Happy.","NDARMJ849UKD":"The beginning of the story, the kid was playing video games. His mom came in and he was ... his mom told him to open the present that she got him. When he opened it, he saw a dog. The dog was kind of ... When he was running he kept falling and looked like he only had three legs. After the dog wanted to play with him with the ball he had, the red ball the dog had, he got up and he had crutches. When he got up they went to go play outside, and he told his mom that they were going to play outside. Then they started to go outside and they were playing fetch. I don't know. Nothing really. His mom. A dog. Playing video games. A red ball. They both ... they couldn't really walk perfectly. Okay. Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad. Mad. Sad. Sad. Mad. Sad. Happy. Happy. Happy.","NDARMP745EAC":"Nope, I haven't seen it. What was it called? The Present. I've never saw that before. Well there was a kid, who I believe couldn't like, walk, so he needed the two things that help you walk. He was playing a video game on there, and he was really excited. His mom told him to open the present, and inside was a puppy. The puppy, at first the boy just like, kicked away the puppy, didn't want anything to do with it. Then eventually, he decided to go outside with the puppy, and that's when I found out he couldn't walk on his own, because he had that thing. That's basically where movie ended. The story? Do I remember anything else? His mom came home with the present, told him to open it. I remember at one point, the puppy went under like the ... The cupboard, where they had all that stuff. He went under there and got a ball, and then one point he was playing around with a box. The boy decided that he wanted to play with him. That's when the boy went outside and told his mom that he was going to be outside with the puppy. I think it was funny. I don't know. His mom. A puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They both ... I don't know. Okay. Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad. Like, angry. Confused. Sad. Angry. Sad. Happy. Happy. This might feel weird, but sad. I think it's sad that he only had one leg. What happened to his other leg?","NDARYL758JGG":"Yeah. Okay. I guess it starts off with a kid playing video games. He is like a shut in, kind of so. When his mom comes home, she brings him a present and that kind of makes him want to get up from the game until he realizes what the present is. And he gets a dog but the dog is missing a leg. So at first, he seems he doesn't really want the dog because it's missing a leg until he starts to realize that they have so much in common. After, it starts playing around with a ball, and because of that, he gets up from his game. It's shown that he's also missing a leg, so maybe that's one of the reasons why he didn't want the dog. He starts playing with the dog and that's the reason why he gets up. No, not really. I just like the message that not everyone has to be, I guess, normal in order for them to have similarities, or you don't have to judge someone or something by appearance or how it may be different or similar to you. I don't really dislike anything about it, yeah. His mom. A dog. He's playing a video game. A ball. First of all, they're both, I think that's really ... They're both missing a leg. That's the big similarity that they have. Yeah. It seemed like it really wanted to see him, like it was excited to meet a new owner, and he also seemed like he was excited at first. Yeah, he was very excited. He seemed like that was something that he really wanted, I guess until he noticed, yeah. I felt kind of happy for the puppy and the boy, I guess, because it's like he's experienced something new. I guess it seemed like it was still pretty happy because I know that pets don't usually, they don't really seem to judge that much on a lot of humans, I guess. So, even though it was thrown on the ground, it seemed like it still was willing to give him a chance. He was upset because he wanted a puppy with four legs rather than three. I guess, pretty upset at the kid because that was like a really not good thing to do. I still think that it was pretty fine even though it got kicked. I still think that it was just thinking that it was still so excited to meet someone new, that it didn't really think that much of it because it was still making an effort to become friends with him. He was still upset and he just went back to his game. Same was way as the previous clip, like upset at him because that's a mean thing to do. Yeah. I think it was feeling happy because it was finally able to get this new person to play with it willingly, yeah. I think they were both sharing the same feelings, especially because he finally got up from bring like a shut in and he finally found a way that he was able to go outside and also have fun at the same time. I guess I felt like relieved that he didn't have the same feelings towards the dog as he did earlier on, yeah. Both.","NDARBR740NKV":"Yeah, I saw it on Twitter once, that little video. It's cute. This boy gets a present from his mom, and it's a dog. I was like, \"Who puts a dog in a box like that and doesn't tell anybody who that is,\" but whatever. The dog is disabled like him. It's like a nice little thing, because at first, he doesn't like him, because you know, he's disabled, whatever, like doesn't have an arm. But then, I don't know. They get along at the end. It was cute. The dog is cute. I did not like ... Oh, well, he was rude at first. He was, you know, not accepting of the dog. I was like, \"Oh my god. Why would you be mean to him just because of that?\" You know? The mom. The dog. Playing video games. A little red ball. They both don't have a limb. Excited. Oh, he was excited, too, and then he realized that he didn't have a arm. Then he was like ... after, but that wasn't in the clip. Fine. Well, I don't think he was too affected, but I could tell that he was rude as fuck, you know? He was mad, I guess. I was annoyed, because I don't like people treating dogs like that and like ... Poor mom. He was sad that he kicked him. Oh, he was feeling mean. I don't know, like ... Happy. Same. Yeah. Good. He accepted him now and they're like the same. It's so cute.","NDARJT517YHZ":"No. He was playing his game, his mom got him a present, and then he opened the present, and it was a puppy. And then, he didn't like him at first, but then he started to like him. They went outside, and they played ball. The puppy. That he didn't like the puppy. The mother. The puppy. Playing a game.

Uh-uh (negative).","NDARMF508PA2":"No. In the beginning, a boy was playing video games, but then his mother walked in with a bunch of stuff, and a package made of cardboard. Then he was still playing video games, and then she had something for him, and she put the box in front of him, on the table. Then he opened it, and it was a dog. Then he carried it, then it was drooling, then he said, \"Ew,\" and then he dropped it on the floor.                     Then when the dog rolled over, he saw a red ball and then he went over there and got the red ball, and came back to him with the red ball. Then the boy, he kicked the ball into the box and then the dog, he ran to the ball in the box, and then the box flipped over him, then he walked with the box on his head. Then he took the ball, and then he rolled over, but then he took the ball again, and went to him. The boy picked it up, and then went outside with him and then threw the ball. \n That the boy was in something on his hands. That the dog, and because ... the dog, that's it. Because of the dog. That the boy ignored the dog. The mother. A dog. Playing video games. A red ball. They're both boys. The boy. Happy, and because I did. Like he was excited, too. Happy and excited. I don't know, maybe still happy? Grossed out. Angry. Still happy. Mad, because he wouldn't get off of his lap. I don't know. Happy. Happy. Happy.","NDARXR637JER":"No. So this boy, he is playing video games, and he's annoying everyone else. And his mom brings him a disabled dog. And he doesn't like the dog so he doesn't acknowledge it, but then he learns to like the dog after a few minutes. But he, when he gets up, he notices and he likes it. He thinks, well he's disabled. He goes outside with the dog too. It's really sweet. I liked it. Not really, no. I liked that he loved, like he loved the dog. And he wasn't so mean to it afterwards. It was a really sweet movie. I really liked it. The animation style wasn't great. I don't really like the dog's eyes that much. They were kind of weird. His mom. The dog. Playing video games. I don't remember, had ball. They're the same because, well, they're both disabled, but doesn't really put a toll on them. But I liked how they're the same because of their friendship. Really sweet. The puppy was feeling really happy. I think he was feeling happy at first, but when he discovered that the dog didn't have a leg, he was unhappy. Warm and bubbly. Sad, but didn't really take a toll on his actual feelings. Upset, because his dog was disabled. It was really sad. Still happy, but a little sad. Upsetish, kind of. Not really happy. Happy. Happy. Happy.","NDARTU777GVV":"Yeah. The boys' mom brought home a dog and it only had three legs. At first, he didn't like it, but then he started to like the dog. Then he went outside and he had only one leg, and then played outside. He pushed the dog away. He didn't really want to play with the dog. I like the dog. It was a nice dog. I didn't like how the guy was treating the dog at the beginning. His mother. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. They both have one leg missing. Happy that he had an owner. He thought the puppy was cool and he was happy with it. Felt good. Kind of sad because the boy didn't like it. Mad at his mom that she got him that dog. I felt bad for the dog. At first, he was feeling happy because he wanted to play, but then the kid pushed him away so he felt sad. He didn't want to even look at the dog. Again, I felt bad for the dog. Happy. Happy because he fell in love with the dog. I felt good for the dog. He finally got an owner.","NDARNV399BV4":" What you mean In the beginning his mom gave him a box then he opened it there was a puppy that he didn't have a leg and then he found a bowl to give it to him filled it and then he came to him and then he got up to go outside to play with him. No. I liked the dog he was so cute and he doesn't have a leg. It's like so cute, so cute. He looks like just like Max from Life of Pets. He doesn't have a lot of His mom. A puppy! Huh? Opening it. A ball. A red ball. Because they both don't have a leg. Okay. Happy. Excited Happy. It was kind of cute. Still happy. Angry. Because he doesn't like his puppy because he doesn't have a leg. Huh? Sad.

And then he was still playing his video game and then like after a few minutes he opened when she went upstairs. And then he opened it and then when he picked it up he was like, \"Cool\". But then when he picked it up he was like, \"Oh no, get away from me.\" I guess because he didn't have a leg like him and like the dog wanted to play with him but he kept on playing his video games. And then like they were, he kicked the ball when the dog got it and then it was chasing it everywhere but the dog kept on falling but the dog didn't give up. He still wanted to get the ball and play with him. And then about a few times, then the kid went to get ... played outside with him. He was playing his video games and he wasn't, he was into it a lot. That the kid went to play with the dog and that his mom got the dog for him. That the kid didn't play with the dog and he threw him. And he was playing his video games instead of playing with the dog. His mom. A dog. He was playing his video games. A ball and the kid. They both don't have one leg. Okay. The puppy was excited to have a new owner. The boy was happy in the beginning but then when he saw that it didn't have a leg he got mad because he didn't have a leg but then he went to play with him at the end. Cool. I want a dog too! Sad a little bit 'cause his owner threw him on the floor and didn't like that he didn't have a leg. Mad and sad because he didn't have a leg and the dog didn't have a leg, so he was like, \"This dog would be useless to play with.\" I felt sad because I wouldn't treat an animal like that and it's bad to be mean to other animals. And he didn't even think to say \"Thank you\" to his mom that she got him the dog. Sad again because the owner kicked him and the dog got on his back and could barely even get up. I think the boy was feeling angry and sad because like, he didn't like that the dog was bothering him, that he didn't have a leg and he didn't want to play with him at all. I don't know. I don't know. Happy and excited to play with his owner because he finally got up out of his game to play with him. Happy because he finally knew somebody that was like him and got to know the dog and played with him. Happy because the boy finally went to play with the dog and you, he had the opportunity to play with somebody that was like him.","NDARRA537FWW":"No. Okay.

Ugh, what is this thing? It's a dog, ew! Ew, I have no emotions. Ew. I was like, \"Great response.\" That's an X-Box.                     The boy doesn't care. The dog doesn't care.\n The puppy was still yapping though. The puppy didn't know what was going on. What? The puppy? He was probably being like, \"Notice me.\" Wasn't that said because he's still yapping and puppies don't really know what's going on. The boy was like ... Apathetic. Not empathetic, apathetic because he decided, no care. Wait, where are my glasses? Why are you taking so much time on an X-Box and low par console when you can just be playing with a dog? It's a dog. What's the problem with it? Get lost. That gave me the sense of relation. It's like, why did he need that then when he left, because like ... That was like the only one I could really hear. That was the ... Happier, playful, affectionate, joyful. Happy, affectionate, joyful. They both ... How was I feeling? Happy, affectionate, joyful with our relationship. Yeah.","NDARPC817XZ5":"No. Basically, what happened was ... I'm pretty sure it was his mom, got him this dog and he was sitting inside playing video games, and not really doing much. Then he ... This dog came, took him out of the box and it was really cute. He was kind of paying attention to him, but then he realized he was missing one of his front legs. He just put him down and then eventually throughout the movie he warmed up to him as he saw him playing with this little ball he found. Then when he stood up you realize his missing some of his leg. He went outside. He went and he played with the dog. I mean, I remember pretty much all ... I couldn't really hear it that well with the sound, but that's pretty much what I got from it from just seeing it. I liked the dog, he was cute. I can't think of what else I like. I like the overall story of it. Well, I liked it all. The only thing was it was ... Since it was hard to hear, I know some of it was ... I don't know, but I liked it overall. The mother? A dog. He was playing video games. A ball. They were both ... I know they were both playing with something. He was playing with the video games and the puppy was playing with the ball. They're both similar because they're both missing some of their leg. Okay. I think the puppy was probably happy. I think he was probably happy too. I thought it was cute. I mean, I was happy. He was probably upset that he was thrown away. He was probably a little annoyed that his mom got him this dog that was missing ... You can tell that he wasn't so happy about it. At first, it was a little like, \"Well, why is he doing this to the puppy?\" I don't know. He was probably sad that the boy, when he was trying to get his attention that he wouldn't really pay attention. He was too busy playing his video games, that he didn't really want to interact with him. I think he was annoyed that the dog was trying to get his attention when he was doing his own thing, really. Pretty much the same as when he put the puppy to the side. Okay. I think the puppy was happy again that the person was paying ... The boy was paying attention to him and he wanted to play with him. I think the boy was happy that he had this puppy and that they had this thing in similar and that he had something that was similar to him in that they could interact. I was happy that the boy was ... The dog were playing together. It was cute.","NDARCU118LMX":"When the mom came home and the boy was playing video games, the mom brought a surprise home for him, and the boy wasn't listening, and then, when he opened the box, the boy, there was a dog, and it jumped on him. And then it licked him. And then the boy didn't like that, so the boy kicked him. And then, the dog found a ball. And then, the dog wanted to play the ball with him, but then, the boy kicked him again. And then, he asked him again. And then, he finally played outside with him. I liked the dog and how the boy played outside with the dog. When the boy kicked the dog and did not want to play with him. The mom. It was a dog. He was playing video games. The puppy was playing ball with him. Because the dog had one leg missing, and the boy had one leg missing. Both. Very happy. He was feeling happy too. I thought it was cute and funny. He felt upset because the boy threw him. He didn't like it because the dog licked him. I thought it was cute because he licked him, but I kinda thought it was sad, because he kicked him and threw him. I thought he was feeling ... When he was on the ground, he felt upset, but then, when he got up, he felt very happy. The boy said, \"No, get out of here.\" It was very sad. He's feeling very happy, because the boy played with him. He was feeling very happy and excited. It was very cute and very nice. I wish I had a puppy. Both.","NDARLY483UNZ":"Nope, I haven't. Okay. So, the mom brought in a three legged dog from the street, and at first the boy, he didn't like it because he only had three legs. And he was like \"Get lost.\" But then, he started to grow on him because he was cute, and then he went to go play fetch with him outside. And then you see that he also has only one leg. Not really. I thought the ending was cute. How he treated the dog in the beginning. The mom. A puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They both have a disability. Both. Very happy. At first, happy. Pretty happy. Upset. Disgusted. Disgusted. Probably confused. Mad. Still disgusted. Excited. Happy. Happy.","NDARAC853DTE":". The dog one? No. The kid was playing video games and then his mom said he had a present and he had a dog but he didn't really like the dog. And then he went outside and the dog went outside, he was on crutches and he threw the ball at the dog and kind of made friends. I didn't get to watch the end well. I only  the beginning like five minutes of it. Yeah, that I watched. Really? Well that should be the whole story there. All of it. I liked everything. I liked everything. I liked everything. The mom. Dog. Playing video games. A ball. They both liked to play. The boy. I think the boy. Okay. That's the best part. First he likes the puppy though, right? In the beginning? Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad and mad. Sad because the boy threw ... Angry. Because he said the dog . He was mad because the dog's annoying him. I feel bad for the dog. . Sad. He was angry again? Sad for the dog again. I wish I had a puppy. It's cute, right? I like that puppy. This the part that ended right there. Happy. . He shows  be so angry. Because he was like \"Go get it.\" He was in a bad mood with ...  happy because he was supposed to play with the dog. I feel happy for the dog because he got to play for once with the boy. .","NDARTK834FT9":"No. Okay. The boy was playing a video game, and the mom came home and put a box on the table. The boy was angry that she interrupted him and nudged it out of the way angrily. And then the boy opened the box when the mom prompted him. He took the puppy out, but threw it on the floor. And the dog went over and found a ball under a table and played with it alone. It went over to the boy, but the boy was still angry because he wanted to play the video game. And then I guess they went outside, but the boy was on crutches and didn't have a leg. Not really. I'm not sure. I guess that the mom had a gift for the boy and that she went out of her way to get a gift. That the boy threw the dog on the ground. That's just animal abuse. The mom. The puppy. Playing video games. The ball. They're living things. The boy? Okay. Excited to see the boy. Excited to see the puppy. I thought that the boy was excited, but then threw it on the ground. So, I don't know. I was torn. Rejected. I think the boy felt ... I don't know how to put it into words, but I think kind of ... I don't know how to put it into words. Trivialized? I didn't notice that the dog didn't have a paw the first time. Yeah. Also still rejected. Angry. Still angry. I don't know, I guess ... I don't know. Happy? Happy, too. Better.","NDARPV145KGL":"I think I have, yeah. Well, it started with this boy and he seemed very antisocial because he was playing video games and his mom said it was a beautiful day and he was just ignoring his mom. So he was back to his game but he also ... later on he found this box in the middle of the table and he was really curious what was inside of it. And, I think the mom said to open it, so he opened it and he found a puppy. But then he thought the puppy was really cool but when he picked up the puppy and found the leg, he didn't like it so he threw the puppy on the floor. And then, the puppy wanted to play with him but he just kept on ignoring it but later on he decided to like the puppy; so he actually got up and got the red ball and went outside to play with it. Um- I liked how it shows that it doesn't really matter what you look like. That's basically it. Do I have to say? I didn't like that he was not really social. His mom. A puppy. Video games. A red ball. Because the boy doesn't have a leg and the puppy doesn't have a leg. Very excited. He felt really excited, too. I felt happy for him. He was excited and then when he threw him on the ground, he felt upset and- The boy was really happy and then when he noticed the leg, he got upset with his mom. Maybe because he had no leg, and he probably thought it was kind of offensive or something. Kind of sad. Kind of sad. The boy was feeling angry. Sad and angry. Very, very happy. Happy and grateful. Probably grateful and happy.","NDARYR829KD8":"No. So, he was playing the game ... So everything was like off. The curtains ... The curtains were closed and the lights were off. The mom came in and bought his son ... her son a present in a box and he was just busy playing his game. Just ignoring his mom. She said, \"Open the present I bought you.\" She went upstairs. He opened the present. He was excited at first. But then he saw the dog was missing an arm and he got upset, I think? He didn't like it and he just liked tossed the dog aside. The dog just was playing around. He didn't really care. But he just came back to like play. The dog just wanted to play the whole time and he saw how he ... Like the dog didn't really notice that it was like ... Something was wrong with it. Like he didn't notice that there was something wrong with him. And I think that's what made him like him. That he kept trying, just came back to him ... Then they went outside to play. Like, he liked him and they went outside to play... Um, he was trying to ignore the dog. Like, he was like trying hard to ignore him. But he like couldn't because of the way the dog was just acting. I liked that the dog was just silly. It got stuck in the box and running around. That was just funny to me that the dog just got stuck in the box and just kept falling and kept trying. It just didn't stop. I didn't like when he saw there was something wrong with the dog that he just threw him away. I didn't like that. Like he was just like there's something wrong with you. But at the end he was kind of the same. I just didn't like the beginning when he was just like I don't want the dog because there's something wrong with him. His mom. A dog. Playing a game. A ball. They both are ... I want to say missing a leg, because I don't know if I want to say missing arm for the puppy, but they were both missing a leg. Like they were both, like kind of handicapped.  Happy. He felt happy at first. I thought it was cute, because like he was playing a game and then he was like \"Oh, I got a dog!\" Like, who doesn't want a dog? I thought it was cute, because he got so happy. He just ... Kind of like stuck in the game  He just wanted to be left alone and then he saw the dog and he was like happy. So I liked that. I think the puppy felt hurt at first because he like threw him on the ground ...  And it just felt a little sad but then got distracted and kind of fun again. Upset, because I think he felt like his mom was trying to change his mind. Like if it doesn't matter for the dog then it doesn't matter for you. That's how I felt like his mom was trying to show him kind of ... I think the puppy felt confused, because he was happy and now he's just like kicking him away ... I think he just felt confused. I can't say it, annoyed. Like he just felt annoyed because of the dog and he was just like a little bit mad. I was like \"Why did you do that?\" I didn't get it. Because like at the end I got it ... At the beginning I was like \"Why did you kick the puppy?\" I didn't see nothing wrong with the dog. It just didn't have like one arm, but I was like \"Wow, okay. If someone did that to you, you wouldn't like it.\" But at the end he was just like the dog so ... Happy. I think the boy felt happy, too. I ... I ... I liked how it end ... Because then he finally just accepted it and they were just like having fun. They were just like ... They were just kind of like the same. Like he noticed that they were the same and he was just like let me just have fun with it. So, I liked it.","NDARKG594WKT":"No. There was a dog...kid playing video games. And he was a brat, and he got a dog and he wasn't grateful of it because it had one leg. And then he had one leg and he went out to play with it, and it ended there. His mom got it for him. I liked the animation, I guess. The kid was stubborn. It was animal abuse. The mother. A puppy. Playing video games. A ball. A red ball. They both had an amputated leg. Both of them. Okay. Excited to meet his new owner. Happy. I didn't have much feelings. I was tired. So that part of the movie, how do you think the puppy was feeling? And how do you think the boy was feeling? And how did you feel when you watched this part? Here's another one. The puppy was feeling a bit energetic cuz he wanted to play with his owner. But, then he felt declined. The boy was feeling stubborn and angry. A bit more aware, I was tired. And that's probably the same answer you're gonna hear for like ... Happy, cuz he wasn't left alone anymore. Happy, cuz he ... I don't know why you feel happy all of a sudden. I was asleep.","NDARWR678HLF":"No. Well, at first, he liked the puppy. Then he didn't. Then he did in the end again. That his leg was off.

Then he ignored it for a few minutes. Then he stopped his game and looked in the box. It was a dog. Then the dog kept coming after him. Then he kept kicking it away. Then the dog found him a ball under the table, a red ball. The dog gave it to the kid, and he kicked it away, and it went into the box. Then the dog took the red ball and he got stuck in the box. Then he got out of the box and then he got the ball to the kid. The dog bring the ball to the kid and he ignored him. Then he started playing with him. He took the red ball, then he got this thing for his arm because he only had one leg like the dog did. He was kicking the dog. Well, I liked what he did when they were playing with each other. When he was kicking the dog and being mean to it. The mom. A dog. Playing video games. A red ball. Because they both don't have a leg. Happy. Happy too. Good. Hurt. Hurt too. Hurt. Hurt again. Hurt again. Hurt. Happy. Happy. Good. Yeah.","NDAREB093GH6":"No. Okay. First this boy, he always wanted to play video games so he didn't pay attention. Then his mom said, sorry he's late. Then the mom put a box in front of it. He kept playing video games. Then, I think the TV turned off. I think he turned it off. Then he opened it and it was a dog with like half, no arm, no leg, and he started playing video games and pushed him away. He was still playing video games. Then when he gave him the ball, he was starting to like him. When he went outside he didn't have a leg. Both of them. No. They both have something in common. They didn't have both arms, both legs.

He's mad because he didn't have a leg. Sad. Happy. Mad. Both mad and sad. Happy, even the boy. Happy. Happy.","NDARGT682ZWN":"I saw the short clip before. I saw it before. So what happened is the mom, her son had a missing leg. So she had an idea and she got him a puppy that also had a missing leg. So she thought that maybe they would bond, but in the beginning the boy didn't like the puppy because he had a missing leg. And then he got mad and he started kicking the puppy and pushing the puppy, and he wouldn't pay attention to it.                     And then at the end what happened was, all the sudden, then he noticed how him and the dog are similar because of their disability. And then they started to become friends, and they went outside and they played fetch with the red ball.\n I remember that in the beginning he wouldn't go outside and he didn't help his mother pack or unpack. And he was addicted to his video games, and when the mother opened the curtain, he was acting like he was blind and he couldn't see. What I liked about the movie was because ... I would say that you can ... It takes a while ... I would say that it has multiple themes in it. And that, I also like it because it's showing how you can have a connection with a dog. Even if you have a disability, you can always find the right dog. What I didn't like is in the beginning when the mom got the dog, and the boy just kept on pushing him and kicking him, and when the dog was falling, the boy didn't help him up. His mother. A puppy with a missing leg. He was playing his video game in the dark. A red ball. They both have a disability, missing a leg. Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think he was feeling happy and not abandoned because, probably his other owner abandoned him because of his missing leg. I think he was feeling happy at first. I felt happy. And I felt like nothing bad was gonna happen. Confused. Mad. Angry and upset. Angry, confused, and sad. Angry, mad, and confused to what happened to his leg. Angry and sad. Happy and ... Happy.

So the kid is playing video games, and then she has a gift in a box for him and then he opens it up, and it's a dog but it's missing an arm. So then he looks at the dog and then he notices that it has one arm and he pushes it away. It's upside down and it finds a ball. It takes the ball and it kicks it to the kid's shoe, and then he still pushed the dog away. And then he wanted to go outside so he went outside with the dog, and then he threw the ball around. And that's basically all.\n No. That they had something in common. That the dog had one arm. The mom. The dog. Playing video games. The ball. 'Cause they were both doing activities. Both of them. Okay. Happy? Happy until he figures out that the dog was missing an arm. Happy. Happy. Sad. Mad. Mad. Sad. Mad. Mad. Okay. Happy. Happy. Happy.","NDARBM173BJG":"Yes. At my school. In writing class. We were doing a response on it. In the beginning; the boy's mom brings in a present, which is the dog. At first, the boy wanted nothing to do with the dog since it only had three feet and it couldn't walk so well. But, then, when he saw how playful it was, he decided that he should give it a chance and it made him really happy when he finally got with it. He also had only one ... He had to use a cast to walk since he also was missing a foot. What I liked was that the boy actually found acceptance to the dog. Was when he neglected it, because it had the same symptoms as him. His mother. The puppy. Playing video games. The red ball. Then, he wanted his owner to play fetch with him. They both have missing a foot. Okay. Yes. He was feeling happy that he thinks it's a new friend. He was feeling happy when he got a puppy. It felt nice that they were starting to feel good about each other. He was feeling a bit mixed sad and happy but, then, he started to feel a little better when the red ball came. He was feeling mad because his mom got him a puppy that was missing a leg. I felt like he was totally being judge-ful 'cause once he saw the puppy he felt happy but when he saw it was missing a leg he threw it down. He was feeling a bit playful and wanted to play. A bit annoyed that the puppy with the missing leg was asking to play when it could barely walk. I felt like he was totally neglecting it. He was feeling happy that they got to go outside. The boy was feeling happy when he finally realized how good of a pet it was. I felt like he finally opened his heart, once again, to the puppy.","NDARUG278FNY":"Yes. Which one are you talking about? The first one or the second one? Oh, okay. Yeah, I saw how ... So, I seen that movie before cause off YouTube and stuff and I seen the boy and the dog, they have something in common and stuff. They both are like handicapped and yeah. No. I found it interesting, just from the kid that plays games all day and then he goes outside to play with the dog that has the same thing in common with him. There wasn't a whole lot that I didn't like. I also didn't like the fact that he was being mean in the beginning, kicking the dog. His mom. A dog. Playing games. A ball. They're both handicapped. The puppy. All right. Happy. He seemed like he was okay about it but I don't think at that exact point, he didn't like it. I thought it was cool cause then I looked closely and I saw how the dog was handicapped with him. Before, I saw that the kid was handicapped, I was just not looking at the bottom of it. Little sad but it still seemed happy. He was mad, disappointed. Probably because the dog was missing a leg and stuff. I think he took a little too rough on the dog. He didn't have to throw the dog and stuff, you know. The puppy was still happy, I still could tell, but it was probably like, \"He kicked me but I only just get back up and try annoying him again.\" He was still ... I guess he was mad. He seemed mad about the fact that his mom got him a puppy instead of maybe like another game or something like that. Also disappointed that he had to throw the dog and kick it. Happy. He probably felt a little bit better because he got outside now instead of sitting in the house all day. I feel a little bit more happy about it.","NDARVT488RXJ":"I have not. Sure. A kid's playing video games, violent video game. Very invested in it. His mom walks in, puts a box on the table, tries to get his attention. He gets aggressive and tilts his head away. And she goes off to take care of business. And she says you should look in the box, look at the present. He opens it and he sees that it's a puppy and he's like, \"Aw this is so cool.\" And he picks up the puppy and he realizes that it's missing its front left leg. And immediately he's like, \"Ew gross.\" And I think he literally drops it on the floor. And the puppy is determined obviously. But I think it's more just it's playful and innocent. So it's trying to play with him, playing with the ball. He's watching it and he's trying not to get invested in it. And he watches it for just a couple of minutes. And he's like, \"Alright fine.\" Wins him over. And he picks up the ball. And then when he stands up he reveals that he's missing a leg as well. So, and then it ends with him going out with the puppy to play. It's a puppy (laughs). It was very realistic, just to the puppy. They didn't try to make the puppy any particularly smart, amazing puppy. It was just a puppy. Like that's how I'd imagine that a puppy missing a limb would act. Just like a regular puppy. The kid was a jerk. It irritated me watching him drop a puppy. Well I'm imagining his mom. It's not said. Is it said?  Yeah you can't tell. But no, it is said. It's his mom. A puppy missing its front left leg. Playing a violet video game. The puppy was playing with the ball. Well they're both disabled. I guess we call it a leg for the dog as well. So both. Okay. Excited. Also excited. Happy. Surprised. Disgusted. Disgusted. Still surprised. Disgusted. I'm gonna double down on disgusted. Alright. Happier. Accepting. I felt the kid got off too easily. He kicked the puppy twice. Both.","NDARUL224GN6":"No. Despicable me or the... The boy was mean to the dog so the boy had no leg and the dog was in the box. He saw he had like the dog so the dog jumped out and he held it and the main thing he did was he saw there was no leg so he like kicked it away and then it came back to him and he kicked it away again and then the dog saw a ball and he was like flipping and playing with it and then the boy chucked and then just made a mad face again and started playing the video game again but then the dog kept on trying to alert him to play with him and then the boy finally played with him and then they went outside and played with each other. No. That the boy and the dog played together. That the boy kicked the dog. The mom. The dog. Playing video games. A red ball. They both had no leg. Okay ... I don't want to see the part again where the boy kicked ...  Happy. Like disgusted out from the dog. Sad at first but happy at the ending ... I don't like that Still playful. Disgusted again. Sad that the boy kicked the dog. That was so sad. So rude. Still playful. Oh, I think he felt the boy was trying to play with him. So disgusted he didn't even want to play with him, the dog. Happy that the puppy was still like playful. The present. Is that a real movie? Happy, finally happy. Happy as well. So happy.","NDARHR763RB4":"No. So in the beginning when he first got the present he was focused on the game but when he saw it but when he tried to open it, the box jumped and he was surprised that it was a puppy but when he looked at his arm, he was mad for some reason. I saw that when he got up, he had a lost leg and the dog had a lost arm and then when he threw the ball in the kitchen, the dog went to fetch it, he saw that him and the dog were the same just because they lost some body parts like the dog lost his arm and the human had lost his leg. Yeah I remembered that when his mom brought the present, he wasn't really focused on it just because he wanted to play the rest of his video games, do some stuff on his video stuff but then after a while he just started to pay more attention. And his mom said, \"Are you going to open the present?\" And after a while, when his mom was gone, he opened the present to see what was in there. Some of the things that I liked about the movie was the part with the dog just because I really like dogs and the part that the human and the dog actually were bonding together and the boy liked the dog just because he had the same thing in common as the boy. Mostly the things I did not like about the movie is when the boy kicked the dog in his stomach. I felt like that was disrespectful to the dog because he was just a baby and he probably thinks that the dog doesn't know much better. The mother just because the mother wanted the boy to pay more attention to everything else. A dog, that is the same as the boy just because they have lost body parts. Before he was given the box, he was focused on his video games and his mom placed a box in front of him, he leaned to the side so he could see his video game more, but then when he shut the thing off he actually paid more attention. A red ball that dogs really like balls and that's because a ball gives a dog an attention like he can play more with you and he can have more fun with the person. The puppy and the boy are the same, like I said, same body parts but also they like to both play with stuff. The dog plays with a ball and a human plays with games or other people and the human and the dog are also the same that's because they are like both playful, the boy likes to play games but he also likes to play with the dog now too. The boy is a missing a leg, that's because the dog as hind legs and the dog had a front arm that was missing. He was feeling excited just because now he had an owner but when he was back somewhere else, he was feeling really sad just because he didn't have nobody to love or play with. When he first got the puppy he was just feeling happy and when I heard the whoa he was like really surprised that he got a dog in the box. I feel like really happy that the dog finally got a home in someone else's home because now he has an owner, somebody to love, somebody to play with, somebody to walk with instead of being alone. He was feeling sad, that's because the boy just thrown him down on the floor instead of like placing him down on the floor, instead he just threw like that because that was really disrespectful to the dog. He was feeling like really upset for some reason just because of the dog only saw his lost arm. I felt when I watched this part, I felt like really bad for the dog that the boy doesn't really like the dog even though some dogs are different and the same. I felt really said for the dog. He was feeling not cared about just because the human kicked the dog when he said, \"Get lost.\" Mad just because the dog, he saw something that was really upsetting to him or he was just mad for some reason that the dog did something or just because they are the same personalities. I felt like the boy and the dog were not getting along at this part and at the end they were, so I felt like this part they were not getting along but I think the next day they're were going to get along. He was feeling really happy now that the boy actually paid attention to him instead of throwing him down and not paying attention and just continued to play his video games. The boy's actually feeling happy now just because him and the dog are now bonding, the boy he now likes the dog just because the dog was like a baby and he really likes the baby dog just because he was cute and funny because I saw that he was laughing but just also just stopped laughing because he didn't want to show the dog that he liked it. I felt when I watched this part that, I actually felt like they were going to be friends forever but the dog actually felt like the boy was watching him and paying attention to him, instead now he'll be paying attention to the dog instead of playing video games or he'll kind of be letting the dog do both, he'll probably take him outside for a walk just because now he likes him.","NDARET550NXC":"What? The Despicable Me one? No I haven't seen it. Well basically, this one boy, he was playing video games and his mom got him a dog. The boy just wanted to keep playing video games and then later he saw the dog was playful and stuff so  decided he wanted to play with him outside. No. I liked that the ending was a happy ending because he wanted to play outside with the dog. Something I didn't like about the movie was that the boy shunned the dog away and just wanted to keep playing video games. His mom. A dog. He was playing video games. A ball. They're both handicaps. Think the puppy was feeling excited. The boy was also feeling excited about having a dog. I felt, both satisfied and angry, because of the different . I think that the puppy was feeling sad that the boy shunned him away. The boy is feeling angry that the dog was handicapped or something. I feel angry because even though if a dog is handicapped you shouldn't shun it away. I think the puppy was feeling sad because he wanted to play with the boy but the boy didn't wanna play with him. The boy was still feeling angry and just wanted to play video games. I felt angry because the boy was still shunning the dog away. I think the puppy is feeling happy that the boy finally wanted to play with him. I think the boy is also feeling happy 'cause he was playing with the dog. I feel happy because, the boy didn't feel angry anymore and wanted to play with the dog.","NDARPL201YL4":"No. Got it. So basically what, in the start, the kid was just playing, he kept playing video games. His mom tried to give him a present and he was just like, \"Get out of the way, I'm trying to play.\" And eventually he opened the box, and a puppy came out. At first, he acted friendly to the puppy but then he didn't because it was starting to interrupt his game. The puppy started playing around on its own. He made a noise at it a few times. Didn't really look like he wanted to play with it. That was the beginning and the middle. Then the end, he took a bit of sympathy toward the dog, got up, even though he had crutches and had to use them. He went outside with the dog and played with him. Not exactly. So the dog wanted to play with him and he just wanted to play video games. How it showed that people shouldn't always play video games and it shows the companionship between an owner and their pet. That he was pretty mean to the dog and he was caring too much about the video game. Even when, if I'm playing or if I'm watching something, I pause it and look up or if I can't stop the game, because I have games like Clash of Clans or Clash Royale, I try to listen while I'm doing it because that game is kind of risk, those games are kind or risky because if you don't do something right, like, you have to fight other people. Not exactly that bad, but you lose trophies and like stuff like that. So I try my best to be able to communicate with people even though I have a screen in front of me. I try my best to communicate. The mom. A puppy. Just trying to play video games. A ball. He just happened to find. They're both pretty friendly and they're both kind of disabled because the dog was really young so he couldn't really run and then the boy his leg, something happened to his leg, so he had crutches. That's one thing. That's only on the outside, that's physically. And then mentally, once he actually went to the dog and accepted him they had a really fun time and he really liked him and the dog really liked him. I think both because the puppy stumbled a few times. Even though it was only a few feet, he stumbled. K Very happy to have an owner because I think he might have not had an owner. Maybe he was like rescued. At first happy. I liked it because he was actually being nice to the dog. A little playful but if I were the puppy I think I'd feel a little sad because someone just threw me on the floor for no good reason. Just because he panted a bit, the dog, and of his tongue, the boy thought he was disgusting. If I had the dog I would have liked the dog and played with him even if I did have a disabled leg. I have never had a disabled leg, but my mom has and even though it is hard to recover you should try to make the best out of maybe walking around sometimes so you can get stronger and he has a pet. We have cats not dogs, but still. We care for 'em. Still a little playful because he didn't understand yet since he was young, that the boy didn't really want him around. Annoyed because the puppy won't let him play his video game and is barking. I think he was being too mean to the puppy. Happy because his owner was actually playing with him. Also happy because I think that he had something more to do than just play video games all day now. I liked it because they were actually showing a bond.","NDARCZ947WU5":"No. The boy was playing video games and his mom gave him a dog. At first, he got annoyed with the dog. When he saw that the dog was missing a leg, too, so then he wanted to play with it. I basically just told that the whole. Eh ... I just don't know how the dog wasn't moving in the box before it got opened. ...  Usually a dog is very hyperactive, but there's like sleeping and then it's like it just wakes up. His mom. A dog. Video games. A ball. They both Mm-hmm (affirmative) Happy. Excited. I don't know. I like cats more. I don't think puppies feel sadness. I don't know. ... I've never seen a puppy feel sad before. They're like so hyperactive and happy. Disgusted. ... Mostly happy, but a little sad. I've never seen it feel entirely sad. Annoyed. I don't know. Happy. More happy than usual. Also happy. I don't know.","NDARGJ627BL2":"Mm-mm (negative), mm-mm (negative). What happened in it is ... the boy fell in a Egypt thing and ... Oh. It was about his mom bought him a dog and with no arm because he didn't have a leg. He probably didn't want him to get made fun of so she bought him a dog without an arm. So then he didn't ... he didn't like it, but then he saw him playing around and being funny but, and then they went out to play. That ... I don't know. I like everything. I didn't like ... No, I liked everything so then ... I disliked is ... I disliked is ... I didn't dislike nothin'. Hm? What do you mean? Mm-hmm (affirmative). His mom. A puppy. Playing Xbox. The ball. Because they both don't have one of their body parts. But it's the same thing. Happy. Not happy because he recognized that the puppy didn't have an arm. I felt ... no feeling. Mad. He was feeling upset. I mean the puppy was still feeling happy but the boy was feeling upset. I felt that was not nice. That's how I felt. Teased? Upset still. Still no feeling. I think they both felt really happy. Happy. Happy. Happy.","NDARVG597HNL":"The kid was playing on his ... The kid was playing the video games. The mom came in the house and gave him the present. The present was a dog. Then, he threw the dog. Then, he went outside with the dog. That's it. That at the last part he went to play with the dog outside. When he throws the dog. Huh? The mom. A dog. Playing on the X-box. The red ball. Cuz they both had one leg missing. Both. Happy. Happy. Which one, the beginning? Both, sad and happy. I don't know, because he got a dog, and he went to play with it. That's disrespectful. Not ... Sad. Sad. Upset. Sad. Hurtful. Mad. Sad. Happy. Happy. Happy.","NDARCG073GZ6":"Mm-mm (negative). Wait, which movie? The first one or the second? Okay. The kid was playing on his Xbox. Then, his mom came home with a present. There was a doggy in the box. He was like, \"I don't want a dog.\" Then, the dog kept playing around. Then, he looked at the dog. Then, him and the dog started playing together. Then, that was the end. How cute the doggy was and how that kid is like me playing on the Xbox. That the kid didn't like the dog at first, because I love dogs whenever I see them, except if they're trying to bite me. His mom. A doggy. Playing his Xbox, like I do. A red ball. They like playing with each other at the end. The boy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Confused, and sad, and angry. No, not angry, just confused and sad. Disgusted that the puppy was licking him. Okay. Weird. At first  confused about, then I saw the puppy with . tied to a Xbox controller. Happy and then like, \"What just happened?\" Still disgusted. Weird. Whoa, they have a giraffe there. Happy. Happy that he made a new friend. Happy.","NDARHD507TEF":"In school. Alright. So what happened is the kid in the beginning, he only had ... Like he couldn't walk because he only had one leg. So he thought that he could just stay home and play on his video games, so that's what he did until his mom came home.                     His mom bring home a package and there was a dog, but at first he didn't really want to open the package because he was so stuck into his game. Then what happened was he ended up opening the package. He saw a dog, then what happened is that he saw the dog only had two legs but one paw. So then he thought, oh that dog wasn't like meant to be, so then he pushed the dog away ... but all the dog wanted to do was play. \n No not really. In the end when he noticed that he had one leg and the dog only has a paw. He noticed that they're both the same. In the beginning when he kept on playing video games and he felt like he didn't have to do anything. He felt like he just didn't have to do anything, what anybody said. His mom. A dog. What was he doing before? He was playing video games. Hm? The ball. Because they're both missing a leg. Happy because he noticed that he actually had an owner. Maybe excited. I felt happy because the dog, he actually had an owner and nobody would take care of him. I think he felt like he was playing around maybe because he was still like, had his tongue out and it looked like he was smiling. Upset because the dog only had one paw, so he was upset about that. I felt upset because the boy, he just pushed the dog to the side. He still felt like he was playing. He still felt like he was playing around. Still upset because the dog, all he wanted to do was play but the boy, he didn't give any attention to the dog. Upset again because the boy, he just pushed him to the side and kept on playing his video games. Okay. Happy because now he noticed that he's actually giving him attention and now he's really playing with him. Maybe happy too because, and well surprised because he noticed that they both similar to each other. Happy because the boy, he actually recognized that the dog only had one leg so.","NDARML406ZB8":"No. He got a present. He didn't like it ... he didn't like the dog that his mom got him. Then he realized that the dog was just trying to play with him. And I think, that's it. Not really. I'm trying to give like a short explanation. Everything? So, he was playing this game and then his mom came home. There was this box and it was a present for him. He opened it and there was a dog. Then, the dog found a ball and he wanted to play with him. Then we was moving around in the box. So then he realized the dog was trying to play with him and he went outside to play with it. Nothing. Nothing. No. I kinda liked that he wanted to play with him at the end. His mom. The dog. Playing a game. The ball. They ... Yes. They are both mammals. When you think about it, dogs and humans aren't that different. No, not anything else, I can say. Wait, wait! They both have hair. Dogs have  more hair. Okay. Happy. Happy, too. But then he started to get a little mad and- Happy. I wasn't really affected about my feelings. I didn't really feel anything. Kind of sad. Mad. Same answer. I don't feel emotions when I'm watching something. Still a little sad. Still mad. My answer is going to be, I don't know. Okay. I think they were both happy. Yeah. Happy, too. Happy.","NDAREK549XUQ":"No. Well, the boy was playing video games and then his Mom came with a package and then opened the curtain and he's like, \"Huh?\" And then he was like,  and then he had the puppy picked up and then when he saw it had one leg he kind of you know, threw it off to one side.                     But the puppy was very determined. When he's upside down.  he's like  and run towards it and then the boy kinda got interested but he was trying not to admit it to himself. And then, well, then the dog, then he kicked a ball back into the box. The dog ran into the box, tumbled a little bit and then when he got in the box, fell on it and landed the box on him. And then he got the box off and they played, then the boy got crutches and went out to the yard and then they played.\n And that's when it ended. It's hard to say. It's hard to stay  when you haven't, you know, just hard to talk about stories sometimes. I like how it had a happy ending so ... That's probably what I thought was the best part. Probably the fact about the kid throwing the dog. That's probably the only part I didn't really like so ... His Mom. A puppy. Video games. A ball. They both were missing one leg. Both. Very happy. Very happy also. Very happy as well. Very unhappy, but very determined at the same time. Disgusted. Probably a little freaked out like, \"What the heck is he doing?\" Very unloved. Probably same as the first clip. Disgusted. Terrified, like, \"What?\" Okay.","NDARXU253JHC":"No. What happened in the beginning was his mom came home. He was playing video games. She gave him a present. He opened the present and he actually found a dog. When he looked at his leg, he was missing a leg. He threw him on the ground, the puppy kept on coming back, he kept on pushing him away. Then he found the ball, he started smiling, but he kept on pretending he was mad. Then he went and he threw the ball, like he kicked it, but after that they started playing together. They went outside and they had fun. It turned out he lost his leg too. No. That they both had missing legs and they were very compared. There were a lot of things that were the same. Nothing. His mother. A puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They both have no leg. Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad. Mad. Sad. Sad. Mad. Sad. Very excited. Very excited. Very, very happy.","NDARCP057XJB":"No, I have not. There was a kid playing a video game. His Mother came home and was like, \"Hey, I brought you a present\". He's like, \"I don't care. I want to play my video game\". And then he opened it, and it was a puppy. He was like, \"Cool, a puppy\". And then he realized the puppy was missing a leg and he was like \"I do not want this broken dog\" so he threw the puppy on the ground and kept playing his video game.                     But the puppy was very energetic and started running around and the kid took no interest in this poor pup. And  like swatting him out of the way. Eventually the puppy found a ball and brought him the ball and started playing with the ball. \n Not really. I liked the plot twist at the end. I liked the character development you could say within the few minutes the movie went on. I mean, I didn't dis ... There wasn't anything that I specifically disliked about it. I didn't not like it. His Mother did. A puppy. Playing a video game. A red ball. They're both missing a leg. Both. He seemed very happy to have an alleged new friend. He also seemed very excited about getting a puppy. I was like, \"Yay puppy!\" And I like dogs, so ... Sad! He was thrown on the ground! I don't know, like a brat. I don't ... he was angry because his puppy was missing a leg. I was angry. He was a good ... that puppy did nothing! He did nothing. I mean in the beginning he got right back up but then the boy kicked him to the side. And he probably was not very happy about that. Annoyed that he now had this broken pup in his life that he did not ask for. I just continually felt bad for the puppy. He did nothing wrong. Seemed very happy. That's a very energetic puppy when they were going outside. I mean he was beginning to warm up to the dog so that's nice. I mean I was glad it was working out. That he could appreciate this innocent puppy.","NDARTJ032FJ2":"Yep. Like five times. Well, the boy ...  you recording right now? Okay. The boy was playing video games and his mom came in and told him to ... what do you call it ... to get outside. Then she went upstairs because she was on the phone and told him to open a present. There was a dog missing a hand and the boy picked it up all happy and whatever. Then he realized the dog didn't have a hand, so he threw it on the floor and was disgusted with it.                     Then the dog was upside down, and he realized the ball under the ... what was it ... like a cabinet? It was a red ball.  He threw it to the boy, and the boy kicked it away in the box. And the dog went to it but he tripped twice because he didn't have a hand. He was in the box. The dog toppled over him. Then the ball went right in front of the boy. The dog tried to get to him. He tripped once or twice. And it got to him. Then ... where am I up to? ... then the boy decided he wanted to play with the dog. Then at the end you see him on his crutches and he's missing half of a leg. Then he went outside with the dog.\n He said \"Mom, I'm going to be outside.\" Well before you thought the boy was nasty because you didn't know he didn't have a leg or whatever. Then at the end you realized he's the same as the dog. He threw the dog on the floor. His mom. The little dog. He was playing video games. A red ball. They're both missing half a limb or a whole limb. Happy and loved ... Like, finally someone wants me. He was excited and happy. I don't know, I felt it was very cute. Like, typical. Wow, this guy changed his mind in two seconds. Disgusted. Sad. Angry. Annoyed. It mad me angry at the boy ... ... and sad for the dog. Overjoyed and happy. Yep. And the boy. Yeah. The boy felt love for the dog. I just felt happy for the both of them.","NDARCL016NHB":"No. A boy, who was playing video games all day, his mom brought him home a box, and she said that it was a present for him. He paused his game, and he opened the box, and a puppy lept out. At first, he was like \"Oh, it's a puppy. I've always wanted a dog.\" Then he realized that the dog only had three legs. Either he had been in an accident, and lost one of his legs, or he was born that way. That made the boy not like him that much, so he pushed the dog away. Then the dog saw this red ball, and he pushed it towards the boy. The boy still didn't like the dog, probably because he only had three legs. The dog kept on being very charming, and he kept on falling over, because he only had three legs. The boy thought that was kind of cute. The dog nudged him so that they could go outside. He got up, and then you realized that he only had two legs, the boy. At the end, they went outside, and the boy had crutches, and they played outside. Good short. No. The dog kept on falling over, because he only had three legs. I really like the dog, because I've seen cats with three legs, but I've never seen a dog with three legs before. How the boy was mean to the dog, at first, because I don't feel that that's very realistic. I think that the boy would have liked the dog, because he had three legs, because he would have been like him. His mom. A dog, with three legs. Playing a video game on the couch. A red ball. They both have one less leg than they should have. Mm-hmm (affirmative). I felt that he... It looked like he was feeling excited, because he had been in a box for a long time, and because he lept out with a lot of energy. Also excited, because he had just opened a box and a puppy was inside it. How would you feel? I don't know. Neutral, because I've seen that type of clip a lot of times, where a boy gets a dog. It's not really original, but I still felt for him because it was cute with the puppy. I felt like the boy was being really rude. I think the puppy was confused, but he didn't really know what was going on. I felt that the boy was being very rude. Disappointed. Still very excited, but more confused. Disappointed, but mad. Still felt that the boy was being rude. Excited. Excited. Mm (neutral)","NDARCW094JCG":"Yeah. Like what movie? Oh. He was playing video games and then his mother ... He got a box and then there was a dog in there but then he was being mean to the dog, to the blue dog. Then when she ... When he found the ball then when he was walking to him he started playing with the dog and going outside with him and playing ball with him. No. When the dog came and when he got the box. That his foot, one of his foots were missing. His mother. A dog. He was playing video games. The ball. They both like each other. Okay. Happy. Kind of not happy. Happy. Um, sad that part because he threw him on the floor. Happy. Sad. Sad again. Happy again. Sad. Happy. Happy. Happy too.","NDARBJ159HXB":"No. This boy is getting a present. It was a dog. The dog wanted to play with him. He took out this rubber ball. It was red. He kept trying to chase it and play fetch. Then, the boy gave up and went out. I saw he had crutches. That's it. His mom wanted him to stop playing video games. The cute dog. That he was sorta being mean to the dog. His mom. A puppy, or a dog. He was playing video games. The puppy was playing with the ball. They both feel they want to play with something, but someone else doesn't want them to play with it. The boy. Okay. He's feeling excited. He thought it was cool. Like the puppy only wanted an owner. The boy he mighta been wanting a puppy. Okay. Confused. He didn't realize that the puppy, he really didn't want it. That the puppy was being neglected. The puppy must've been sad. I think that he was feeling the boy didn't want him. He didn't want the puppy. The boy didn't really want the puppy. He was feeling like the boy actually wanted him again. The puppy wasn't that bad. The boy liked the boy after. The boy.","NDARDN489EXJ":"Yes. Okay. The mom, there was a boy on the couch playing Xbox, or any other game system it was. The mom walked through the door with a box. She placed it in front of the boy. She was on the phone, I believe, and walked upstairs or in to the kitchen. The boy put the game on pause and placed the controller aside him. He opened the box just a little bit and the dog popped out in excitement. The boy was happy, too, but when he lifted up the dog, he realized that the dog had an amputated left arm. He didn't really like it. I don't know why. He tossed him to the floor and he continued to play the game.                     The guys scootched up by leg, and he kicked the dog aside. The dog was on his back, and he saw the ball underneath the ... whatever, the desk, or whatever. It was a red ball, and the dog went to retrieve the dumb ball, and he got the ball. The boy looked at the dog while he was going underneath the table. Then, he looked back up at the game. The ball hit the boy, and the dog did a face. I think the boy kicked it into the box, and the dog went to go get the ball. He was limping a little bit, and tumbling, and falling. He ran into the box, and the box flipped over him. The boy looked up over the game and looked at the box to make sure the dog was okay or whatever. The box, the dog was trying to get out the box, so he started moving around a lot. The boy shook his head. He was like, \"I don't care about this,\" and looked back to the game. \n From this story? The story was sad, but fun at the same time because both of them have a common trait of not ... probably being picked on, from the dog being a dog, like inside of the adoption clinic. He was probably being picked on by other pups. The boy is probably picked on at school, so they share a similar experiences in life from losing limbs. That he started to care for the dog. He started to care for the dog because he felt bad because it was just the same as him. But I can say the dog was little more stable than him because he has three other legs, but still weren't being  and stuff. I can say, probably like at the end of the movie, they became really good friends and stuff. That he didn't appreciate the dog when he first saw the amputated leg, arm. The mother. The box was a brownish- Oh, what was in the box? A dog. Playing video games. A red ball. They have one lost, amputated limb on the left side of their body. Oh, that's actually like ... The boy. All right. That's fine. I know dogs can stand on their front legs. Puppy was feeling excited to be, to have an owner that thought, cared for him, and would play with him, and help him grow, and they would be together forever. The boy was feeling real happy at first. He was like, \"Oh, this is great. Like better than a video game,\" but he turned the dog a little bit to the side and he saw that it had an amputated leg or arm and threw him to the floor. When I watched that part, when he threw the dog to the floor, I didn't really feel good about it because it's another system in this world. You have to take care of it, and give it care, and love, and affection just as you would expect your parents to give you. You have to treat care of the animal. When the puppy was in midair going towards the floor, I think he didn't really know what was happening, but he felt a little unappreciated. That's it. Disgusted. Unbelieved. Confused. Aggravated. Angry. The puppy was feeling better than before. I can definitely tell that. The boy was feeling a lot happier to have someone, a companion that shares similar emotions to him. Happy.","NDARJV268PNW":"No. It started out, like, this boy, and he looked like he was kinda like, really, addicted to playing video games. And then his mom came home with a dog, well, a present, and he opened it, and it was a dog. And he wasn't being very nice to the dog. And the dog tried to play with him, and he just kept kicking him away. And then, he noticed something about the dog, that he didn't have a full limb. And then, he looked at it, and he kinda got happy with it. And then, he picked up the  outside. And then he walked, and then noticed that he also didn't have a full leg, too. No. I like that he eventually loved the dog. That he was being mean to the dog. His mom. A dog. Playing video games all the time. Huh? A ball. They both don't have a full limb. Okay. Happy that he has an owner. Oh, a dog. To me, it kinda looked like he was feeling happy, but not that happy. It made me feel happy for the dog, that he has a home. That made me feel kind of upset that he just threw the dog. Not that happy. Frustrated. Kind of upset. Still, not that great, because he kept kicking him aside. Again, kinda mad that the dog just kept bothering him. Kind of upset that someone would treat a dog that way. That one made me feel happy, because the dog and the boy were playing, and it's like he stopped playing video games to go hang out with the dog, and they both were playing with the ball. Happy. Happy. Very happy.","NDAREY778CR9":"That was a lot easier than I thought. Yes. Actually, when I was at the Child's Brain Institute in  Island, I saw that one. Yeah, it was when I was doing the EEG. In the beginning, it's a boy that's playing video games, and his mom walks in, and she puts a box on the table in front of him, and she opens the blinds, which kind of annoys him, because he can't see his video game. And she says that he has a phone call, and asks if he can open his present.                     After a while, he gets kind of curious about what's in it, and he finds a dog, but it has one leg that's been amputated. And for some reason, he doesn't like the fact that it's missing one leg, and he thinks that it's weird and disgusting, so he puts it down on the floor by throwing it, and basically, starts to play video games again.\n Well, it did sound like, that he was playing one of those video games that sounds like it's fighting. And the dog was really excited, and it wanted to do everything, and play, have fun. I loved the amount, how the dog, even though he was missing one leg, was still able to run and play, and how they were kind of a match for each other, in ways, helping each other understand. It doesn't explain much. From the beginning, it doesn't explain how this happened, like how he doesn't have a missing leg. It just starts off with putting a present on the table, and it doesn't give any details about what happened before. His mother. A dog that was missing a leg. He was playing a video game. A red rubber ball. They're both missing a leg. Excited, and happy, and really curious, at least some ways. Excited and happy. Excited and happy too. I kind of got how they were feeling. Who doesn't want to find a little, cute puppy, who's all happy and wants to jump around and have fun ? I think he kind of felt a little bit abused, and he didn't know why he was being thrown. Annoyed and disgusted. I felt really annoyed and angry to the boy . He threw a cute little puppy on the floor just because he was missing a leg. I mean, who does that? He's a cute little puppy. Still kind of abused, but he wanted to still have fun, even though he'd just been thrown on the floor. And he really wanted the boy's attention, and he wanted to play. He was still feeling disgusted and stuff. And he was getting angry now that it just came back up to him and started annoying him when he was already doing something. Still angry at the boy, because why would anybody wanna do that to a pup? I feel kind of angry at the boy. Happy, excited, and I think that it would explain it, but he just really wanted to play the whole time. And now, he was probably really excited and happy. The boy was actually wanting to go with him. I think that the boy was happy, still, just like the puppy. And once he saw how much the puppy was getting  trying to play, that he just , because it kinda made his heart feel. I was so happy seeing the way that they both understand each other, and it was kind of a happy ending.","NDARRY280KNW":"Okay. He was playing a video game, and then his mom gave him something, like a box. And then he found a dog. And he thought he had a collar, which he didn't, so he put him on the floor and kicked him.

And the puppy started wandering about the house, and the kid frantically changed from watching the game to the puppy, until it was just the puppy. And then he was staring at the puppy who had the ball at his legs. And finally, the clip shows a picture of his legs, showing that he's missing a leg as well, and they went outside. Not much.

The boy kind of just shrugged it off. Then for like a few minutes he was like, \"Okay.\" And then like you realized the boy also was missing like a leg.

The mom went upstairs, he opened the box and there was a dog with only three legs, and he tossed it aside, because he didn't like it and he continued playing the game. Then the dog found a ball under a table, and wanted to play fetch with the kid. So, he nudged the ball to the kid and the kid kicked the ball, and the dog went after it. Then the dog brought back the ball to the kid, and he kicked it again into a box, and the dog ran and stumbled, and kept stumbling. Then, went into the box and the box flipped over on the dog.

Then the kid kicks the dog and the dog thinks he's just playing around. Then the dog tries to get the ball again because it got out of his mouth, and the dog kept on tripping. He went inside the box and the kid laughed because he ... Because then when he got up, I saw that he had a missing leg too. Then they went outside and played. His mom went on the phone with somebody.

He just wanted to play video games. That like everyone has someone that's also alike. Like he only had on leg and two arms and his dog only had two legs and one arm. So the dog helped him like open the door and stuff. The boy was ignoring the box and he probably would have heard the dog moving around in the box, So he probably would have opened it like in curiosity. His Mom. The dog. Playing video games. A red ball. They both have a leg or an arm missing. Okay. Probably excited to get out of the box and to see that he has a new owner. Excited that he has a dog. That the boy finally found someone to play with instead of using the TV because he couldn't exactly get around that easily. Probably upset but probably the puppy thought it was kind of a game.

Then later on, the kid stopped playing the video game and went outside to play with the dog. I noticed that the kid was just like the dog. The way that the dog convinced the boy to go play with him, it was by using the ball to try to make the kid notice him more. That the dog and the boy had a relationship, like they were connected. I think that's why the reason the mom bought that kind of dog. That I didn't like that the dog kept on falling because he did have the extra leg. The mom. The dog. He was playing his video game.

I didn't know it was going to be an adult, but it's disabled, like with one arm lost. You clearly can't see that the kid is disabled too, but first he didn't want a dog, and then he saw he couldn't walk, so he threw the ball. That's all I can really remember. Oh no, I think I can remember he tried to take a call, and the dog kept falling. He had these crutches, I don't know what they are called, but there were like two, so you could put a grip; it's like a cane, but with two handles. Trying to remember. He got off the game to go outside with the dog and play with him. That's really what it was mostly ... I think it was only like two minutes, so that's all I really got out of it. Which one, the first one or the second one? I like how the dog was barking, because I know a lot of dogs and I have one myself and it always barks. It's annoying, but at the same time its funny. So I guess I can relate to it. He was rude to that dog. It doesn't matter whether you like animals or not, you still shouldn't treat it like its a piece of garbage. So, that's what I thought. The mom. A dog. He was playing games on the TV, or whatever. Could be XBOX, I think. A ball. A red one. They are both disabled. I guess you can say that, not to be rude or anything. And they both like to play games. So I guess that's how I seen it. I think both, because I don't know if it is an arm for the dog, but they have four legs, so I am guessing a leg. Happy, I guess. It saw a human. I don't know, I'm just guessing. I thought he was happy too because it was different, but at the same time both shocked. I guess, like any other kid would, happy to get a dog. I already have one, so I'm used to it. Sad. He just threw him. THat's messed up. I think he was mad, I guess, because he was disabled. I don't know. I was mad. I would be so happy if I had a disabled puppy, no matter what was wrong with it. That's just my opinion. He was happy at the beginning, but after he got kicked, I think he was mad. He is still pissed off. Still same, like mad, because I don't know why somebody would do that to an animal. Happy. And then the boy was feeling was happy too, if that was your next question. Better, because I don't like Kevin, like I said. Both.","NDARUT470BM4":"Yes, I have. It started out, there was boy playing video games. Some kind of shooter or something like that. With lots of guns and explosions. And then his mother came home with a box, and she put down the box for him it was a present, it was a gift. He didn't really pay attention to it. But eventually, he opened it, there was a little puppy in it. The puppy was missing its left forearm, leg. Anyways, and he wasn't thrilled, to say the least. Kind of cared more about the game, he kind of put the puppy down. And then they went outside and played. Just like, details? The mom meant to send a paper to someone that didn't go through. It's strange where he lives, it just kind ... I know it's just because they probably didn't want to fill in with the background, but he just lives in the middle of nowhere. It was cute. I mean, the puppy was cute. The puppy seemed very real, just kind of running around, barking. It was a sweet little connection they had at the end. It was a good short film; it was kind of keeping it short, concise, and just yeah ... sweet. I mean, I'm sure it had some kind of moral message; it personally didn't resonate with me all too much. But I couldn't really see anything specific that was trying to say something larger. It just kind of seemed to be; I guess, you know, they both have disability I suppose. That connection between the two despite the fact that they initially didn't really get along too well. But ... I mean it works, it just ... Yeah, I think it's just me. It's ... it's short.... The mom. A puppy. A little golden retriever. It seems. Playing some sort of PS shooter video game? A ball, red ball. And he was playing with an Xbox, the most original Xbox. Interesting. They're both missing a left leg. Both. Ecstatic. It's a person, the person's holding him. He was in a box before and now he's not. I think first happy that he had a puppy. I think in that moment, he was like, \"Whoa, that's a dog.\" But then ... It was cute. Sweet.  Cute. I don't think he cared or noticed all too much. I think he was just kind like, \"wee.\" Because like, I don't think ... because I definitely think the puppy at some point, if that continued, would definitely feel kind of hurt. But I think the puppy didn't really care in that sense. I think it was just kind of happy. Still. I think he definitely was not happy. He was, he felt almost betrayed by his mom and disgusted that the puppy also, well not also ... maybe also ... didn't have a leg and what a garbage, defective puppy. Asshole. Am I allowed to say that? Am I allowed to say that? Maybe a little more defeated, but I also, I still don't think the puppy really cared still. I think the puppy was just happy to be in a place with a person still. Just annoyed. Just like ... probably a little bit disappointed, because it's like, \"oh, there was a puppy;\" but then for whatever reason he doesn't like this puppy because it doesn't have a leg. And he's just disappointed, if anything, but I think he also just doesn't care about the puppy. I think he's more invested in his game. It's just a mean thing to do. I mean ... Very, very happy. The puppy ... this ball, that's the greatest thing in the world. The ball's flying and I can run after it. Woohoo! It's very happy. Satisfied. I think he was, like, realizing that there's, you know, there's a connection there. And he was like, \"You know, maybe this puppy isn't bad, maybe this puppy can be a puppy. And that's, like, amazing.\" It was cute. It was nice. I felt satisfied as well. It was a nice ending. You know, the short didn't call for anything super dramatic.

So, in the movie the mom bought the kid a puppy. When the kid saw that the puppy lost a leg, he pushes away the puppy like it doesn't ... Like he doesn't even care about him, and he just pushes him away. The puppy sees a red ball, so he gets the red ball, and he asks the kid, in his own way, to play with him, but the kid said, \"No.\" The puppy tried again, one or two more times, and the last time the kid said, \"Yes.\" At the end, the kid started to like the puppy and decided to start playing with the puppy. I don't remember anything else. I liked that the puppy didn't give up when the kid said no to the puppy when he wanted to play with the puppy. I mean, when the kid didn't want to play with the puppy. I also liked about the movie ... Something else that I liked about the movie is that his mom didn't just let him play all day and actually tried to make him get off the games and all. I did not like ... One thing I did not like about the movie is that when the puppy wanted to play with the kid, the kid just pushed the puppy away like it didn't even matter. Another thing that I didn't like about the movie is ... Another thing I didn't like about the movie is that ... Wait. I forgot. I can't remember. The mom. The mom gave the box to the boy. A puppy. He was playing games, like shooting games. The puppy was playing a red ball that was under a cabinet. The puppy and the boy are the same because they both lost one leg. Okay. I think the puppy was feeling happy and excited that he was finally getting adopted and he was finally going to be a member of a family instead of just being in an old cage or something. At the start, he felt excited and he felt the same as the puppy, but until he saw that the puppy lost a leg, he was like, \"Ew\", and pushed him away and threw him. In the middle, he was like he didn't even care about him. He almost ignored him, like fully ignored him. At the end, he was like ... He knew the puppy wouldn't start giving up and anyways, he liked the puppy, too, at the end, so they started playing together. I felt happy at the start that the puppy was getting adopted and all. In the middle, I felt a little bit sad for the puppy because the kid wouldn't want to play with the puppy when the puppy wanted to play with the kid, with the red ball. At the end, I was really happy that the kid finally agreed to play with the puppy. Okay. I think the puppy was feeling let down and sad that he was thrown away like it didn't even matter. I think the boy was feeling really mad that the mother got him a dog that lost one leg because he thought it was gross and ew. I felt really sad for the puppy because he was thrown away and it might have hurt him. I think the puppy felt let down again. Maybe he was like, \"Oh man, why can't he hug me?\" I think the boy started feeling like he didn't even care about the puppy and he wanted to ignore the puppy, and yeah. I felt a little bit more sadder because the puppy tried to hug him and all, and kiss him, but the kid just threw him away again. Yeah. I think the puppy was feeling really happy and excited that the kid finally agreed with the puppy to finally play with him and the red ball. I think the boy felt happy and ... I think the boy felt the same as the dog, just maybe a little bit ... Maybe just happy for the dog that he's finally excited and more and all. I felt happy that the kid finally agreed that to play with the dog so he wouldn't throw him over or something and really hurt the dog.","NDARGT551AFK":"Which movie? It's about how he was disabled, and all he did was play video games. So, they bought him a dog that was disabled also, but that can help him navigate to different places. The dog liked to play fetch, with the red ball. I liked how they were similar, the dog and the boy. Nothing. The mother. A dog with three legs. Playing video games. A red ball. They both like to play, but it's different. Happy. At first, the boy was feeling happy, but when he saw only three legs, he thought it was offensive. He will adapt. The boy will adapt to the dog. Still happy. Mad. I don't know. I felt like it was very unnecessary. At first, sad, and then tried to get attention. The boy felt mad. Again, unnecessary. Very, very happy. Happy, and confident. Soothing.","NDARBU532YXZ":"Not that I remember. Well, from what I could tell, since I didn't really have my glasses, so some of it was blurry, but a kid, who had walking issues didn't want to do anything. He just wanted to sit inside, play video games all day. So his mom brought home a puppy dog with a missing leg. The dog wanted to play with him. But the kid kept on just ignoring the dog. Then eventually, he warmed up to the dog a bit, and he took him outside. They played. He played with the dog, and then it ended. The kid was obsessed with video games, and he had some walking disability. I think it was a very cute idea of the kid with a walking issue, learning to get along with a dog that has a missing leg, since they're very much alike. The kid seemed kind of unnecessarily . He threw the dog. He was kind of disgusted by the fact that it had three legs. He was like, \"Eww,\" and he threw it. The mom, or at least what I think was the mom. A puppy dog with three legs. Video games. A red ball. They both have leg disabilities. The puppy was missing a leg. Happy. Happy, excited. Amused, it was very light hearted, fun. The puppy still seemed very happy. Very grossed out, and annoyed, because he kind of originally was like, \"Oh, my mom is doing this. Oh of course, she got me a dog that has three legs, because oh, I have a leg disability, yay.\" Annoyed that the boy just kind of threw the dog. The puppy seems to be happy, extremely excited. Very annoyed. Still mad at the boy, because he's literally just shoving, and ignoring a cute puppy with a missing leg. Oh, he was missing a leg. Very happy. Happy. Very satisfied.","NDARUJ779NM0":"No. Well he was playing the game and then his mom came in. And then his mom said, \"Stop playing the game for a few minutes and looked for  Garcia.\" And then he like kicked the dog. He got mad for a few minutes and then finally the dog wanted to play with the ball. And then he just put it in his pocket and then went outside and the dog opened the door frame.                     And then he had his, his things to walk. And then the dog went under him and then they were playing.\n His mom going upstairs. That they got along at the end. That he was like, like rude to the dog and mean. The mom. A doggy. Playing the game. The ball. They both like to play. The boy. Okay. Happy. Happy. Happy. And then in like the middle he started getting- Mad. Like, like mad. Like uncomfortable. Like he doesn't want it at first. Sad. Unplayed with, like he wasn't playing with nobody. He was alone. He wanted to play. Like a little disappointed that his interrupting his game. It's a little rude to the dog and a little mean, meanful. Okay. Happy and the dog was being so nice even though he was being mean to him. Happy. I feel comfortable.","NDARTH473LF8":"No. Well, the kid was playing video games. Then when the mom came home, she brought a box for the kid. It was a present. When the kid opened it, there was a dog, but it only had three legs. Then he pushed away the dog, and the dog found a ball and kept on playing with it. Then the kid turned off the video game, and went outside with the dog. It turned out that he was missing a leg. No. That the kid finally made up with the dog, and started to like it. Nothing really, I like it. The mom. A dog. He was playing a video game. With a red ball. Because they're both missing something. Both. Excited. Excited too. I felt happy for the boy. I feel like, rejected. All mad that the mom had to do this to him. Sad. I think he was feeling rejected again. Sad, and mad that the mom had to give him a dog that only had three legs. I felt mad that boy wouldn't play with the dog. I think he started to feel excited then that the boy was playing with him. Happy that the dog is liking him, and he's playing with him. Happy for the boy and the dog.","NDARZN277NR6":"No. From the beginning? I couldn't really hear, but like, that's why, I think I know ... There's like a little boy, who's playing video games, we couldn't like ... He's just like playing video games. And then he's mom came in, she put like a thing in front of the controller and he was like \"mom, I'm trying to play video games.\" And she was like, \"Okay, open your present,\" and he opened it and it was a dog, and he was like, \"Aww.\" And then he was like, \"Wait, no, I don't like you.\" At first I didn't know why he didn't like the dog, because I thought he was just like, \"Oh, I'm playing video games.\" But then I realized it was because the dog only had like three legs or something. And I was like, \"Oh, that's sad.\" And, I think the dog was trying to get the ball, and he kept failing, cause he couldn't, cause he only had three legs. And I don't know, and the boy probably was like, \"I don't know.\" He was like watching him, and it was like ... I guess he was like amused? And then he ended up picking up the ball and going out to play with him, but then we see that the boy has like one leg, and it's like oh, that's cute. Like his mom got him a dog that has three legs, and he has one leg so it's like cute. I don't know. Just cute. Like what do you mean? Like details? Or messages? Oh, I don't know, I think that the boy was like happy cause he related to the dog. He was like, \"Yeah, same. I feel you man.\" I don't know. I don't know. There was a happy ending. I don't know, it was cute. I mean, I don't know. He was rude to the dog, and I was like, His mother, I'm assuming? Cause he ... A dog. With three legs. He was playing video games. A red ball. Cause they both have like a missing limb. The same one? Can you turn this? He was like, I mean I don't know dogs just like people. I mean that dog was like a friendly dog. He was like, \"Oh yay, an owner.\" Probably couldn't see that the boy had one leg. I can't tell if he noticed the dog had three legs yet. I didn't notice until like I saw the dog running. But maybe, I don't know, cause you couldn't really tell. I feel like he might not have noticed at first. And then he did, and he was like, \"Oh, that's a little weird. I'm gonna put this down now and play my video game.\" I was like, \"Aww, a boy and a dog. That's cute.\" I don't know. I like dogs. Yeah. He was like, I don't know he probably felt like, I mean, he felt bad because the boy threw him on the floor. He was probably, I mean, at first when read it I didn't ... Saw it, not read. When I saw it I didn't really understand because I didn't see the dog only had three legs. But now I know he probably felt like, I don't know, he probably just felt like awkward. He was like, \"Oh I don't want a dog that looks like me.\" I don't know. But then he was like, \"Yeah, never mind. Whatever.\" Well the first time? Like for the first time? Oh like how did I feel when I watched it for the second time, or for the first time? Oh. I mean, like it makes more sense. Like it's not okay, but it makes sense. Like the first time I was just like, why would you just throw a dog on the floor. Like that doesn't make any sense. But, you know ... Whatever. But this time it makes sense cause like, it wasn't like he was allowed, like it's not a good reason to throw a dog on the floor, but it makes more sense. I mean, the same from the first time. Just like, cause he just threw him and then he went back and he was like, \"Nope, don't want you anymore. Kick. Get lost.\" Annoy ... I mean he was probably annoyed, and he probably felt bad, but like, he was like ... I don't know, you can't see it but he probably felt bad, I'm assuming. Cause like then he ends it up not hating the dog, so like he probably ... Because his first reaction was he liked it. And then he didn't like it. I mean, the same as I felt when I watched the first time he reject the dog. I was like why? Like it's a cute dog. Like stop. Ah, that was like good. That was like the, \"Oh I get it!\" Cause like, I don't know it's cute. It's just like ... I don't know. I don't know, he was probably ... This is so cheesy but he was happy? I don't know, like I think, \"Yay!\" He was probably just like ... He probably just accepted it. He's like, \"Yeah, whatever.\" This ... He's just like, \"Okay I'm just gonna like play with this dog. Cute dog.\" I was happy. I was like, \"Yay! He likes the dog now. Finally, God.\"","NDARAV610EY3":"No The kid was playing video games and his mom came and brought him a present and ignored him ... and when he opened the present he saw it was a dog, but saw it was missing a leg, so he just ignored it ... and the dog was trying to play with him and as soon as the kid gave in, the dog and the kids went outside ... and the kid was also missing a leg so, they ended up, I guess, having a lot of fun. Not really. I like the way it had a kid and a dog interacting. I don't really know. The mom. A puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They're both missing a leg. Both. I think the puppy was feeling excited that he has a family now. I also think he was feeling excited and I think, like, he thought the puppy was going to be a really good addition. Pretty happy. I think he was feeling sad and that he was just left alone. Disappointed that the puppy wasn't exactly what he wanted. I felt kind of sad that the boy just dis-offed the puppy. I think he was upset that the kid didn't want to play with him. I think he just didn't like the puppy. I felt kind of mad at the kid.

And I guess he didn't want to see it because he was too focused on the video game. Then after that he opened it up real quick when she went up the stairs and a dog popped out. He seemed excited to see it until he saw that it was missing a leg. He put it down and stared kicking it to the side. After that the dog started going after the red ball, started running around and it caught his attention. Right then, he thought it was finally funny so he got up. I thought he had both his legs but he got up he was missing half of his other leg. They went outside and from there they just started playing. At the end, where they got along after. When he was kicking the dog aside. His mom. A dog. Playing video games. The red ball. They were both missing ... well he was missing a part of his leg and the dog was missing a part of his leg. Excited to have a new owner? He was excited. I felt good. I think he was feeling a little excited until he got dropped to the floor by the boy. He didn't want the dog because he didn't have no arm. Aggravated. He was trying to get his attention and then when he kicked him the puppy felt like he didn't want him. The owner ... the boy didn't want the dog around.

First he doesn't really know what it is, and he can't really walk, 'cause he's also missing a leg. First he just doesn't like the dog, 'cause it's just distracting him and his video game. Then he realizes ... He starts kicking the ball, but then the dog brings it back. When the dog brings it back, it gives him an idea, like to stop playing video games and play outside with him. So, he opens the door, brings the dog out, and plays fetch. There were a lot of bleeping sounds ... be bo bo bo bo bo. The movie. Also, it's weird how he, usually, just tries to kick the dog away, 'cause I like dogs. It's very ... It gives you an idea what to do when you're bored.

When he saw the dog playing with the ball, he decided to have fun to play with the dog outside. And then he ... then he felt happy cause he probably doesn't wanna play video games anymore. He like just wants to play with the dog like the whole time. No. Like when he was playing with the dog. And when the dog showed him how fun it could be with no leg. When he hold him and he looked at his leg and he was like this, \"ugh\". His mom. The puppy that had no arm. He went back to play with video games. A ball. A red ball. They're the same because they both don't have a ... no leg. Okay. This happens. That happens when it glitches. Yeah. He was feeling happy in his new home. He wasn't feeling too excited in the beginning, but at the end he did. Like he showed me to be happy when you saw a dog with no leg ... but you wanna play with him because you don't have leg. That doesn't happen all the time. And when you find a puppy with no leg, do you just wanna play with you from their new home. Cause he wants to see if he likes puppies or not. That's why letting him play with the ball with him. He was feeling sad because he pushed him ... cause he dropped him on the floor. He didn't like the puppy cause he saw him with no leg. I like feel worried about the puppy. When he fell, he couldn't get himself up. He only rolls, when he gets himself up. When regular dogs have legs, they just put one of their leg on the ground and then they stand up with the rest of them ... but that one can't.

He didn't like the puppy, because it had no leg. But he didn't have no leg, because, he forgot that he didn't have a leg. I felt like, why the boy cannot play with his puppy, because he wants to show him why puppies are friendly, when they see people. They feel excited when they see people ... when they live at the streets. He was feeling happy because the boy wanted to play with him. Cause he saw him playing with the red ball and he was starting to smile. He was feeling happy because the puppy showed how it's fun to be with puppies.

It starts with a boy and he's playing with some video games or something and the mom comes in the room and she's like, oh here's this present or something. There's a box and the kid like, oh I don't really care. The box moves a little bit, which is enticing and then a little puppy pops out and you're like, oh look at the dog. And the kid seems kind of unfeeling and just continued playing his video games and the whole like pup pops out and he only has three legs and you're like awe look at the little guy. He was already cute before and now it's just like I feel bad for him. And he has a little ball and the kid just still is completely disinterested and the dog has the ball and the kid kicks it away cause he doesn't really care but after that the dog gets the ball and you're like oh he just wants to play fetch and he like stumbles a little bit because he only as three legs and he gets the ball and the kid starts becoming interested but he's like oh never mind.                     And then he keeps playing the video games or whatever he was playing and then after that he starts taking more interest in the dog as the dog ... he kicked ... the boy prior had kicked the ball into the box that the dog came in, which was on the floor at this point and the dog stumbles into the box and in doing so the ball flies out of the box and the dog runs with the box on his entire body because he's a little guy. He slams into the dresser, the drawer, whatever the TV's on, and then after that the ball is on the floor. The dog brings the kid the ball and he stumbles to him. The kid is like I'm fine and a smile grows on his face. And he gets up and then you see that the kid only has one leg as well. Yeah.\n I remember he was using an X-Box controller. I remember he was playing first person shooter. I remember it was like a blue something, I forget. I remember the ball rolling over to the fridge. I remember the counter being locked and I remember him leaving the door opened. And the crutch he had was much orange. That's pretty much it. I liked the message. You can have normal actions and still be impaired in some way. And that's kind of motivating and moving. I liked the parallelism between the dog and the boy and the dog had the same, or at least really similar, disability as the child, but the dog stayed happy throughout. And the kid was probably like a sad kid cause he only had one leg. But after playing with the dog, he was like oh yeah I can be happy too, I don't have to just stay here and play video games the entire time. I don't know. It was fine. I liked the animation. I don't know. I couldn't really hear the mom as much, but that was not really due to the movie. Yeah. The mom. The puppy. He was playing video games. A red ball. They're both disabled in the same way. Both. He was probably very happy. Probably also happy, cause now he has a puppy in that moment. I was like oh yeah, the kid has a puppy and the dog only has one leg, wonder if he notices. Kind of little surprised. Yeah. The boy seemed kind of disinterested, like oh it's toy that's broken. Yeah. I was kind of surprised but I had already seen it. I knew what was going to happen. I don't know. The second time around I just thought it was funny how he just tossed the dog aside because no one would actually do that. But yeah, just a little weird. Probably didn't really care. He got back up like immediately. It didn't really seem like he noticed very much. Disinterested, just generally. I was like oh yeah, the dog's probably going to try to reinteract with boy after this. Yeah. Probably happier than he was before because now he's like oh yeah the boy is playing with me. Yay. Yeah. Probably better as well because he's like oh yeah, alright, maybe I shouldn't just treat this dog like a broken toy and instead like a dog. I was like yay, the boy is not a jerk anymore. And he has the dog now. It's better. Yeah.","NDARYL771XDP":"Yes. What, the puppy? I never seen that movie before. I thought you meant Despicable Me 3. He was playing video games, and, then, his mom got a present for him. He opened the present. It was a puppy, but the puppy was missing a leg, like a paw. Then, he started being ... He acted mean to the puppy at first cuz he kicked it and said, \"Get lost.\" Then, the puppy found a red ball, and he threw the ball for the puppy, so the puppy would go away, but then it went into a box and started playing around in the box. Then, he thought the puppy would be a good pet. He went outside with the puppy. He lost a leg too, so they were playing fetch outside. He wanted to stay inside and not go out, but the puppy changed that, so he would go out. I liked that- That they lost a leg. His mom. A puppy. Playing video games. A red ball. The both lost a leg. Happy. Happy. Happy too. Angry. No, the puppy was feeling scared. The boy was feeling angry. Mad at the boy. Sad and alone. Angry. Angry and sad. Happy. Happy. Happy.","NDARPV303LAX":"No. So, his mother came in and had a box and gave it to him. He was still playing his video game. But then he opened the box, and there was a puppy, and he was like, \"Cool.\" And then he saw the puppy had his arm cut off here. So then he's like, \"Ah, disgusting,\" and he threw him aside.                     I felt really sad that the puppy was ... like if you have a puppy that is disabled and has like three legs and one arm. No, two legs and one arm, that's sad. You should care for the dog and be nice to the dog. \n Yeah, so at the end he looked at the dog who was playing with the ball, and then the puppy gave it to him. So then he got the ball and he put it in his pocket. And it appears that he, the boy, didn't have like one leg. So then he played with the dog and was caring to the dog, and he said to his mom, \"We'll be outside.\" The things that I liked about the movie was that I liked that the mom gave him a present, and he cared for the dog at the end. I didn't like that he was still playing his video game when the mom gave him his present, and he threw the dog aside and judged him by how he looked. The mother. The puppy. He was playing his video game. The ball. They liked to play. The boy is missing a leg. Okay. He was feeling excited. Feeling excited also. I felt excited. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Good. Good. Good.","NDARZW930MF2":"No. Okay, so there was a boy who was playing a lot of video games. And his mom thought he was on them too much, and she got him a puppy, which was missing a leg, and the boy thought the puppy was odd. And he didn't really like the puppy. And he just continued playing video games. And then, the puppy brought him a ball, and he threw the ball. And then the puppy did a lot in a box, and then ran around, and eventually got the ball back to him. And then, the boy got pretty annoyed. And he eventually realized to appreciate the dog. No. I liked the story. How short it was. His mom. A puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They both have disabilities. Happy. Happy. Happy. Upset. Sort of weirded out that the puppy was missing a leg. I felt bad for the puppy. Very sad. Angry at the puppy. Still bad for the puppy. Happy. Happy. I felt happy that the boy learned to appreciate the puppy.","NDARDF373ZDW":"No. The boy was playing video games and his mom got him a dog and he didn't know what to do with it. And then he started to play with it at the end. He was trying to like get the dog away from him. He was playing the game system. He was kicking the dog out of his face. His mom. A dog. He was playing games. A ball. They like to play with balls. The boy. Good. Happy. Happy. Fine. Annoyed. So-so. Sad. Angry. Sad. Happy. Happy. Happy. The boy.","NDARCW933FD5":"Yeah. At the Child Mind Institute, the building, they put this weird sticky cap on my head and I had to watch that. Okay. So the boy, he's playing video games. And then his mom comes home and brings him a present and he opens the present and it's a dog that has lost one of its legs. And the boy doesn't really like it because it's lost one of its legs, so it's like, \"Ew, go away. Get away from me.\" So the dog finds a bone and starts playing with it and then he kind of grows on the boy and so he starts playing with the ball a lot and the boy starts smiling. And then the boy takes the ball and he tells his mom he's going to go outside and you find out that he also lost part of his leg, like the dog. And then they go outside and play. Yeah, he was playing a game that involved a lot of moaning because the video game  moaning a lot. I kind of liked where the mom gave him the present. When she said, \"Why don't you open up the present that I gave you?\" And when she opened up the blinds and he's like, \"Meh\" because he couldn't really see the light. I didn't like how the boy was so mean to the dog when he knew that he was like the dog. He also lost part of his leg, so it's like why are you being so rude? He's a lot like you. The mom. A puppy. Playing video games. The ball. They both have lost part of their leg. Very happy because he might have felt finally appreciated. Happy because he had someone to play with, maybe. I felt happy for the boy and the dog because they had companions to hang out with now. Very hurt, mentally and physically. Upset. Very mad at the boy. A little hurt, but ... Still pretty upset. Really mad at the boy. Puppy was feeling really really happy and finally appreciated. Happy to have a companion that's like him. My heart just bloomed with happiness.","NDARMF116AFR":"Yeah. Well, it started out with this boy playing video games at the TV and he's really focused and didn't want to be annoyed by anybody else. And then his mom gives him a box and he's just really not interested and then he opens the box and then he sees a puppy but he notices the puppy is missing a limb. So he kind of just throws it to the side and doesn't care about it. And then the puppy wants attention but he doesn't care and he kicks it and stuff. But then the puppy wants to play a game and he kind of just throws the ball away from the puppy. And then the puppy's just doing the thing like trying to play the game by himself and then he sees that he can still without having that extra leg that he's still able to have fun and play. And so he decides to go play with him outside. That's when they reveal that he's also missing a leg. The puppy was kind of growing really close with him, wanting to play. Well, I liked the dog and I guess seeing the kid kind of realize ... I don't know how to explain it but I guess he was kind of dealing with a little bit of self hatred too until the puppy could help bring him out of that. Well, I didn't like to see the puppy being kicked. He's so cute. His mother. The puppy. He was playing games. The ball. They both are kids, both missing a limb. Okay. Really excited, kind of didn't know what to do. Also excited. I forgot that the puppy was really adorable. Kind of shocked and really . Angry. Disappointed. Neglected and wanted attention. Just annoyed and dismissive. Still bad, disappointed. Again, excited and really just doesn't know what to do with all of this excitement. Enlightened. Happy.","NDARWV487HE0":"No. I don't really remember.Cause, and then I start to close my eyes. And then I keep opening my eyes. I remember the end when the boys playing video games. And his mom brought home a dog that's like him. Cause the dog was missing a leg, and he was missing a leg. So, they both had disabilities. And then, at first he didn't want to play with the dog. He picked up the dog, then he just threw it down. He didn't want to play with the dog. But then, later on, I thought he was just going to let the dog run away, but he went outside, in the yard, in the front yard, to play with the dog. Not really. I liked how the dog was finding things to play with. When the boy threw down the dog. His mom. Well, the woman. The dog. Playing video games. A red ball that he found under the counter. Cause they were both disabled and they were missing a leg. Both of them Happy and excited. Happy and excited. I did .... In that part, how do you think the puppy was feeling? How do you think the boy is feeling? How did you feel when you watched this part? Here's another one. Sad. I think he's still upset. A little mad. Wanted again. Okay and Happy.","NDARDY150ZP9":"No, I haven't seen it. Well, it was about a boy, and he was playing video games a lot. And then his mom came home with a box, and then he was really bothered by it because it was in his view of gaming. And then his mom opened the curtain, and then his eyes returned to normal because he was playing in the dark. And then he kept on playing for a while, but then he was interested in the box, and then he opened it up, a puppy came out, and then, he thinks it's a normal puppy, right?                     And then the puppy came out, he was interested, but the dog peed on him, I guess, a little, and then he threw him on the floor and was abusing the dog a little bit by kicking him. And then I noticed that the dog was three legged. And then afterwards, the dog was upside down because they kicked him, and then the dog saw ... I think he was upside down, but he saw a red ball under a cabinet or something, maybe a refrigerator, I'm not too sure. But the dog found the ball, and a little bit clumsy time trying to get it, but it managed to get it, and then it was stumbling around and he was ... and the boy was still playing video games a lot, but he was from time to time focusing on the dog a little bit, and getting interesting. \n Well, then afterwards he got up and he told his mom that he was going to go outside. And then they threw the ball around, and that was it. It was an accomplishment and inspirational story, and I really like how it was around theme, like to appreciate what you get, and appreciate what you have what now, and what others give you. And that I think he needed a company. He's distracting all the loneliness from him that he had around him, like playing video games. But he didn't know that the loneliness would still be there even if though he would be playing video games. And then, when he found the puppy, he found happiness again. No, nothing at all. His mom. A puppy. He was playing video games. A red ball. They both have something missing in their lives. Both. Okay. Happy. Happy. I felt surprised when I first watched it, and then the second time I watched it I feel happy for them. Bad there. Disgusted. I feel mad a little bit, because he threw the dog, and that made me upset. Ignored. Annoyed. Still mad. Happy- ... overjoyed. Happy. I'm glad. Both.","NDARRB359CRR":"No. Okay. So, they both have two broken legs. The boy didn't want to play with the dog and he kicks the dog away, then the dog decides to play with the ball, then they both go outside. He opens the package and finds a dog, a little puppy. What I liked was the puppy was cute and ... yeah. I don't know. His mother. A puppy. He was playing Call of Duty. The ball. The puppy and the boy are the same because they both have broken legs. I think both of them. Okay. Happy. Happy. Happy. Still happy. Mad. I don't know. I think the puppy was feeling happy. Mad. I don't know, maybe happy. Happy. Happy. I felt happy.","NDARWR732NZE":"I didn't see the present. The little boy, I don't know his name, his mom just gave her a box, and he opened it. It was a dog with a lost leg. And he didn't like it. And the puppy found a ball to play with. He wanted to play with the boy, and he kicked it, and the puppy brought it back. Then, the boy got outside with the ball and threw it to play with. Done. No. I don't like it, really, kind of. I don't know. The mom. The dog, the puppy, I mean. Playing the video game. The ball. They have a lost leg. Happy. Happy. What? I don't know. Any feeling. I don't know. Sad. Bad. Well, I don't know, same feeling from before. Sad.  happy or sad, I don't know. Mad. I don't know. Same things. I don't know. Happy. Happy. I don't know.","NDARML024FF2":"No, but that character, the dog looked familiar. I feel like I saw that character before, but not the boy. Okay. The boy is playing his Xbox 360. The mom brings in a box. The boy doesn't know what it is. It's a dog with three legs. He gets mad. He's like, \"Get lost.\" To the dog. The dog wants to play. Then, a few times,  the boy finally says yes. He's like, \"Alright.\" He brings crutches or something and I thought to myself, I was like, \"Wait a second.\" I find out he only has one leg too, just like him. I found out that was a little messed up because he didn't like his own kind. The ball was red. He was playing an Xbox 360 game. About how the dog and the boy got along in the end. How the boy was like \"Get lost\" to the dog, and the dog didn't do anything to him at first. The mom. A dog, a puppy, to be exact. Playing Xbox. A ball. The leg. He felt happy because he got a new owner and also the boy felt like that too. I just said it. I'm like, \"Oh, yay. The dog got adopted.\" Sad. Angry. Pretty pissed off. Sad. That the dog was a piece of shit. Sorry. Sad. Happy. Happy. I felt happy. Wait, hold on. I felt happy because we actually found out, in that clip, that the boy also had no leg neither. I'm finished? All of it?","NDARMM951YEH":"Yeah. No, I have not, even though I have seen a lot of shorts, like, little short movies at the end ... near the end of my summer break this year because I'm already at summer break. I mean, near the end of school, we watch bunches of shorts, but I have not seen that one. So at first, the boy was playing his video game when Mom came in and  a package. It was his present as in ... He was so focused on his video games that he didn't really open his present. But when he did, he saw a puppy. And he liked the puppy. Until he saw that he was missing a leg. Then he didn't like him anymore. And then he said, like, \"Scram!\" And then the puppy saw a ball. He went to go get it. And then he brought it over. He just kicked it back. Brought it back over again, kicked it back. And then the next part that I remember is that he got up ... he got up but then I realized that he was actually missing a leg too. And then I think that's all. I do not. That the boy was missing a leg and the dog was missing a leg. So they were actually alike, pretty alike. That the boy tossed the dog, because I love dogs. I have three dogs in my house. Two gigantic great danes and one little puppy. His mom. A three-legged puppy. Playing video games. The ball. I just told you, they're missing a leg. Happy! Happy! Happy. Sad. Mad. Kind of sad and mad because I do not like it when anyone throws dogs. Actually, he stayed happy most of the time but I think he was also a little sad. Mad like \"mmph.\" Being bad to dogs, to be honest, I feel like I shouldn't have watched that clip.. Happy. Better because they do ... because they don't toss the dog anymore.","NDARYZ909VND":"No. Well, this kid's mom, he, he gave, she gave him a puppy, and he was playing video games, and he opened the box and the puppy jumped out, and he noticed it didn't have an arm. The kid didn't have a leg. So, he was handicapped. And, it was, he got mad and just pushed it off of him and off the table. Well, he wanted to play with the red ball and he went and played with it. They went outside and played with it. Um, ... being, um, ... some of the things I liked about the movie is that it was like, it made me kind of sad, because it was a puppy, yet it ... Him being mean to the puppy. The mom. A puppy! Playing on the TV. Playing games. He was playing with the ball. They both don't have, ... he's a, the puppy doesn't have an arm, and the boy doesn't have a leg. Happy. Happy. Very happy. Confused. Mad and shocked.

He's feeling happy and sad, because it was a dog and he got one. I felt surprised because they never said if it was someone's birthday, or Christmas. Mad because he didn't have a hand. Annoyed because the mom felt they had something in common, because he didn't have a leg and the puppy didn't have a hand. I felt kind of annoyed, just because he didn't have a hand doesn't mean you can't like him and have fun with him. Mad, because he kicked him. Annoyed. Annoyed, because you shouldn't do that to a dog.

And then the mom walked in with a box, and she put the box on the table. Then she went upstairs, she answered the phone, then she went upstairs, then the boy was looking at the box. And he opened it. And a puppy came out. So the puppy jumped onto him then he kicked it. Then when he kicked it, the puppy tried it again, then he kicked it again.                     Then the puppy saw a red ball underneath the cabinet. Then the puppy got the ball, and then he brung it to the boy. Then the boy ... Then the puppy wanted the boy to throw it. \n And then, the boy and the puppy got along. So then the boy took the puppy out to play fetch. Some things I liked about the movie was that, when the boy met a new friend. What I did not like about the movie was that when he kicked the puppy. The boys mom. What was in the box was a puppy. He was playing video games. The puppy was playing a ball. The puppy and the boy are the same because, puppy was born with three legs and the boy was born with one leg. Both. The puppy was feeling happy when he saw the boy. The boy was feeling, excited. I felt excited to. What I thought, was I thought that he was going to be nice to the puppy. The puppy was feeling sad. The boy was feeling mad. When I watched that part I felt sad, because the boy threw the dog on the floor. The puppy was feeling sad. The boy was feeling mad. I felt basically mad. Because the boy should not kick the dog. The puppy was feeling excited. He was feeling excited. I felt excited because now the boy met a new friend that he ... Now he has a friend that's just like him.","NDARBU607ZZ3":"No. In the beginning, he was playing video games and his mom came in and put a box right in front of him and he told his mom to move and then after a while, he opened up the box and the dog came up. He picked up the dog and then he saw that it only had three legs, so he put the dog down and he didn't want the dog and then he kicked the dog. And then the dog found a ball and then he bought the ball to the kid. Then the kid kicked the ball so the dog ran after it. And then he tried to find it but the guy kicked it into a box and the dog went into the box and then he got stuck in the box. And then he figured out his way and the guy thought that was funny. So he took the dog outside and he started playing with it. The guy only had one leg. He had one and a half leg. The doggy. He was mean to the doggy at first. His mom. A dog. Playing video games. A ball, a red ball. They're both missing a part of their leg. Mm-hmm (affirmative). Happy. Happy too. That part, I said that the dog was cute. Sad. Mad. Sad. Playful. Annoyed. Sad still. Happy.

There was a boy who was like a young teenager who was playing video games at home and then his mom came home with a cardboard box.

It's nice outside.\" And he was like, \"Nah.\"                     And she put the box down on the table right in front of him, and he looked around it 'cause it was in his way. And then she's like, \"Why don't you open up the gift I got for you?\" And then he opened it up, and it was a puppy.

A red ball. I kind of explained all these things. They're missing ... Well, it's kind of the same and different because they're different sizes, but the dog's missing a foot, and the boy's missing half of his leg. I gotta watch it again? Okay. Oh, I can actually hear some Wow, that's horrible. It was so off sync. That's all I could focus on was the lag. Really happy. Really excited. Besides the fact that the lag was horrible, I was like, \"Okay. Cool.\" Confused. Disgusted and angry. I have a neutral feeling throughout this whole thing. It was just, \"Oh, that's cute.\" That's really it. I've also seen this before so I know what happens. He wanted attention from the boy and then he wanted to play. Still angry and upset and disgusted. Neutral. They have a giraffe decoration. That's so random. I watch animations a lot so I notice this kind of weird stuff. Excited, happy. Happy.

Then he says, \"The present's for me?\" Then he opens it up and the dog jumps out and he picks it up and he's like, \"Awe.\" But then he looks at  I think a right leg and he's like, \"Ah, disgusting.\" Then he just threw it on the ground. Then it saw while it was upside down, he saw a ball and he grabbed the ball, took it to him. He kicked the ball away, but the dog thought he was probably playing fetch and went into the box. He jumped the box and the box fell on top of him. Then he moved around and then he got out. Eventually the boy went out to play with him. Then he realized that the boy only has one leg. I had a one leg dog too. I was like three. It died. Yeah. Cool. No. That there's a dog and he's playing Call of Duty, because I play that game a lot. He threw the dog on the ground. The animal abuse.

But, later he don't play. He just play, play. After a later, he just open the box, and there was a puppy. He pick it up, then the puppy don't have one half a front leg. That's why he just don't want to pick it again. And he just liked that puppy because when the puppy found the boy, then the puppy  that to the boy. The boy throwing the box. Then, it was funny. He liked that it was funny ... he liked the dog. Then, the boy don't have also a leg, and the dog also don't have a leg. That at the end, they both friend each other. They make a friend each other.

He shows distaste for it when he learns the puppy has a disability. But then the puppy starts to grow on him as he sees it try to go about its life. Finally, he decides to outside and play with it, and it turns out that he has a similar disability. No. I liked how they didn't reveal that the kid had a similar disability until the end. So, it didn't show why he showed distaste for it at first, but then it was revealed at the end. That was very clever. Plus, that dog is a meme waiting to happen, running around in the box. I think I disliked the way the kid was portrayed, being a little bit cruel towards the puppy at first. His mother. A puppy. Playing a video game. A ball. They have a similar disability. All right. Probably a little bit confused, but also happy to be out of the box. Probably excited to have a pet. Dubious about the  would be. Probably confused as to why he was thrown on the ground. Disgusted that his mother would give him a pet that had a disability. A little bit sad for the puppy. Confused, but also determined to get its owner's attention. Resentful of the puppy. Resentful of the kid for kicking the puppy. Happy to be accepted. Glad that the puppy didn't judge him for what happened earlier. I mean I'm glad that the issue was resolved.","NDARMT784NED":"No. First, the mom came in with a package with an open ... it was open already with a dog in it.

His mom came in and gave him a box and when he finally opened the box, there was a puppy inside. At first, he was really happy, but then he saw that the puppy's leg was like, not there, and he got upset and didn't want the puppy anymore. He kicked a ball and then the puppy ran after it and tried to get it. It was a little bit difficult for him, but he came back with the ball. And the boy started to warm up to the puppy and he started to be happy about the puppy again. And then he decided to go out and play with the puppy and you saw that the boy also didn't have his leg and both of them were going outside to play together. Not that I think is particularly important. I thought it was really sweet, 'cause at first I was like, \"Oh, that's so sad, he doesn't want the puppy.\" But then when I saw that they both had something in common and they both seemed really happy in the end, I thought that was really sweet. I'm not sure, like at the beginning I was like, \"This is sad.\" But, by the end, not really. I assume it was his mom. Puppy. Video games. Red ball. They both have a leg missing. Happy. Happy. Happy.

Him like being mean to the puppy. His mother. A puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They both lost one of their legs. Yes. Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad. Mean. Not really ... I was feeling sad.

In the beginning, the kid was playing a video game and the mum came in with a present for him. And in the middle, he's still playing video games and opened the box and there was a dog. But then he saw that the dog only had three legs and he didn't really like it that much. And at the end, he saw the dog playing around and he really thought it was funny and cool, and he started to like the dog. And then we also found out that he only had one leg. No. I liked that eventually that the kid really liked the dog. That was nice. And I also liked just how the story was of it. It was really cool just the characters and everything, and the whole entire premise of the story was cool. I didn't like how the kid ... He didn't really like the dog because the dog only had three legs and the kid also had one leg. It's not like I didn't like the director doing it, I just didn't like the character doing it. But, yeah. And besides that there isn't really anything else. I thought it was a really great movie. The mum. A dog. He was playing video games. He was playing with a ball. They're both disabled, they both don't have one leg. Okay. The puppy was feeling really excited and everything. He was also feeling excited that he got a dog now. I felt really happy that ... It's really cute and adorable. Puppies and everything. He was kind of sad that he was just thrown on the ground. He was feeling really disappointed and upset that the dog only had three legs. It made me feel really sad that he would do that just because the dog is kind of disabled. I think the puppy was still kind of happy, hyperish. Because he did he a new owner and at the end, he still looked fine even when he got kicked away. He was feeling kind of upset or kind of bothered about how the dog kept bothering him. I felt kind of annoyedish because it was really rude even if he don't like the dog, he shouldn't just kick him. The puppy was feeling very excited because the kid start to really like him and they went to play outside. He was also feeling happy and everything. And he realized that even if the puppy is kind of disabled, it's still a really nice puppy, and he was really happy because of that. I felt really happy because it's really nice that they just became friends.","NDARXF203DCD":"Yeah, I have. Yeah. My sister showed it to me on YouTube. There was this boy that was playing video games. His mom comes in and gives him a present. He opens it. It's a dog, but he sees that it's missing a leg. He gets mad, and he throws it to the ground and continues playing his video games. Then, the dog sees a red ball, and it starts chasing it. He sees it chasing it, and he thinks it's funny. Then, he picks up the ball and he takes it outside. It shows that he's also on a single leg. When he was watching the dog play with the ball, when he thought it was funny, he tried to pretend that he didn't think it was funny and went back to playing his video games at one point. The animation was really good. Yeah. What are some of the things you did not like about the movie? Cool. Who gave the box to the boy? What was in the box? What was the boy doing before he was given the box? What was the puppy playing with? What do the puppy and the boy have in common? Let's watch a short clip from the movie and talk about it. It takes a second to load. It seemed really excited. At first, he seemed excited, but then he realized it was missing a leg so he felt angry. Then, at the end, he felt happy again. I thought it was cool. It still seemed excited even though it got thrown to the ground. He started feeling angry and disgusted even. I'm not sure. Maybe it reminded him about his leg or something. It kinda surprised me. It seemed like he was really mean. Just 'cause it was missing a leg, he threw it to the ground. It seemed to still feel really excited and happy in that part. He seemed to be angry still, really angry. I was kinda scared for the puppy's safety. Really excited and happy. He seemed happy as well. I was happy. They got a happy ending and stuff.

He tried to ignore it, but the puppy still played, like, was cute and was happy and clearly didn't care that he had three legs, a missing leg. Then, he kind of decided to halfway through, or kind of at the end decided he was going to play with him outside, and then he stood up and he only had one leg. I thought it was very, how it showed, sweet. How it showed the puppy after kind of being thrown to the side still having, being able to enjoy himself.

But then the movie taught me something. It taught me something, how to be, how to just stay outside and do something fun. At first, I really didn't care about it that much. Like the dog was just innocent and he did absolutely nothing wrong. His Mom. Dog. Video games. His ball. That the leg is missing. Both. Uh. He got this dog. Kind of happy, at first. Kind of happy because he opened it and it was a dog. And I was like \"I thought it was just another video game.\" He was pretending to be fine but then he just, then he just put it down and then it took awhile for him, it took him like a good two minutes. I thought it was pretty shocking. What's that? Eh, kind of confused. A little angry because I don't know what that meant at first, until I saw his leg and I was like \"is that?\" I was like \"is that?\" And my mind said \"yep.\" Is that an X-Box? He was like \"come on, let's play\" Forget it. Gasp, it that? Is that? Is that, is that! Now he's really happy. He was feeling now relieved now that the puppy had taught him something. Well at first when I finally see him stand up I saw that \"what's with the crutches\" and I figured it out and I was like \"wow\", that was it, that was all I have to say.","NDARJG300HWH":"Huh? Un un. I think it was  or something. Well, he got a puppy, he was still playing his game, and then his puppy had trouble running. He kept falling. And then they went outside to play. Un un. That he liked the puppy at the end. That he didn't want to play with the puppy. His mom. A puppy. Playing a game. The ball. They both like to play. Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad. Disgusted. Happy. Playful. Mean. Sad because nobody should treat a dog like that. Happy. Happy. Happy.","NDARCH881EFG":"No. I don't know. Maybe. Yeah, so the kid was playing video games and his mom brought home a box. She opened up all the shades. I couldn't really hear it that well, but he wasn't really happy about it. Then the dog kept on running around and stuff, and he realized that the dog didn't have a leg like him. The dog got stuck a lot and fell over, and he nudged the ball back over to him, and they went outside and played with it. No. I like dogs. I was sad that he didn't have a leg, but ... That the dog didn't have a leg. The guy also didn't have a leg. There's nothing really else that happened that much. The mom. The dog. Playing video games. A ball. They both don't have a leg. Well, they're both missing one. All right. Happy to finally get out of the box and excited to have a new owner. He kind of said it. He thinks the dog is cool. I guess he's excited. I don't know. Happy. Why'd he say, \"Uh?\" Sad, because the kid is disgusted with the puppy because he doesn't have a leg. Disgusted. Bad for the dog. Sad and disappointed. Angry. Angry because that guy seems mean. This has to be some sort of Disney movie. Both of them were happy. The same.","NDARFF644ZGD":"No. So, he was playing his games and he opened his present, and he saw the puppy didn't have a leg. So, he kept playing and he watched him little by little until the dog got him playing with him because he has a lost leg too. He lost his leg too. No. That they played together. Him like kicking him away from him. His mom. A puppy. He was playing his games. Um, a bone some. Because they both lost their leg. Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad. Angry. Sad. Sad. Still angry. Still sad. Happy. Happy. Happy.","NDARRL685WB7":"No. Okay, in Despicable Me or the last one? Okay the kid, so he was playing video games that his mom bought him a dog. Then the dog didn't want to play with him but then he kept saying he didn't wanna play with it and then the dog got a ball and then the kid kicked it and then the dog went to go get it and then he thought it was pretty fun so he took the ball and he went outside with the dog. That's it. No. Despicable Me I liked. The dog still had courage. The kid was being mean. His mom. A dog. Play video games. The ball. They both like playing stuff. Okay. I won't see the whole movie. The movie's long. The whole movie's long. That was it? It was just like, that was quick. Super happy. A little happy. Happy. A little sad. Sad. Mad. I felt sad. Still sad. Still mad. I feel mad at the boy. He lost his leg? How's his leg gone? Happy. Happy. Happy that the boy finally was playing with the dog.","NDARRV480PU1":"Well, in the beginning, there's a boy, he was playing video games. And his mom found a present for him. And the present was a dog. And in the middle, he was- he picked up the dog and realized it didn't have a paw on one of the legs. So, he just started to play more video games 'cause he thought like the dog wouldn't really be that much fun because it doesn't have a paw. And then in the end, he was watching the dog, and then he realized that the dog's really cute and he decided to get him. And I guess the dog probably reminded him, the dog reminded him of him because he didn't have a foot or a leg. Um. The dog was like playing around and hitting things. I liked the dog, 'cause it was cute when he was running around and banging things. I liked the whole movie. His mom. A little puppy. He was playing video games. The red ball. Because, they both don't have a foot or a paw. Or the boy doesn't have a leg either. He was feeling like excited because it had a new owner. He was feeling excited, 'cause he said, \"Whoa,\" and he was really happy. But then he saw the puppy didn't have a leg. And then he just threw it on the floor. Um. I felt that was a little rude. A little sad. But he was still happy after that. A little upset, because the dog didn't have a paw. A little funny. Like a little happy because he's rolling around. Mad It was pretty funny. Happy, because the boy started actually playing with him. Happy. Happy.","NDARDE294HNX":"What? No. In the beginning, the boy wasn't doing anything but playing, and his mom told him to go outside but he didn't want to. And he got a puppy. Yeah. At first, he didn't like the puppy since he had only three legs, but then finally at the end, he stopped playing his game and realized that he needs to go outside. And I noticed that he, his arms are broken, and the dog is missing an arm. It shows how cute the dog was. I didn't like how the boy was ignoring the dog. The mom. A dog. He was playing. A ball. They, something is both gone. The puppy. Excited. Happy. I was like, okay. Sad. Weirded out. I felt sad. Sadder. I don't really know how to describe it. Sadder. Happy. Happy. Happy.","NDARFK610GY5":"Yes. The boy first is playing video games, and then the Mom came in and brought him a dog, and found out that he had no leg, and so he was grumpy at first, but then he liked the dog. He didn't have a leg too. And then, they played fetch. He had to wear crutches, and that's about it. The puppy was pretty cute. Kind of gross, at first, when he found out that it didn't have a leg. His mom. The puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They both were missing a leg. Happy. Kind of happy. I don't know. A little dejected. Grossed out. I don't know. Kind of bored. Anxious to play with the ball. Annoyed. Kind of annoyed. Happy. Happy. I don't know.","NDARJJ343TR0":"No, I haven't seen it before. It was kind of new to me. At first the boy was playing a video game, then his mom came home with a dog in the box, and when he opened the box, the dog had half a leg missing. After that, the boy treated the dog bad because it had no arm, but then after a while, he realized that the dog was like him, because he didn't have a leg and the dog didn't have a leg either. Yeah, I remember he was on crutches and walking outside to play with the dog that he got. I liked the end where he threw the ball, and the middle where he got the dog and the dog was tripping over him, tripping over because he didn't have a leg. I didn't like how the boy was treating the dog bad just because it didn't have a leg. His mom gave him the box because she noticed that he was on the game too much and she wanted him to get off the game for a while. Inside the box was a dog. A dog without a leg at all. The boy was playing on his console before he was given the box. The puppy was playing with a red ball that he found underneath a counter. The puppy and the boy are the same because both of them only have half a leg and yeah, that's it. Both of them were missing a leg, because when the boy got up, he was on crutches, I noticed that he had half a leg gone and the dog had a half a leg gone too. The puppy was feeling excited to have a new owner, because it probably didn't have a owner just because of it's difference in its arm. The boy felt excited for that first part, but then after he noticed the arm gone, he decided to throw it on the floor and kick it. I felt excited at first, but then when he threw the dog down, I felt sad because the dog was like him and he didn't realize it. The puppy was feeling excited because it was feeling happy in the first place because it had an owner, and yeah, just because it had an owner and because of its arm difficulty, he wanted a new owner. The boy was feeling excited at first because he got a dog, but after a while, he realized that the arm was gone when he took it out the box, so he decided to just throw it on the floor and just kick it. I felt very sad because the boy treated the dog wrong and he should have known that the dog was like him, because they both didn't have half a limb. The puppy was feeling sad at that part, because he wanted to play with his new owner, but then the boy kicked him just because of his arm. The boy was feeling very mad because his mom got him the wrong dog because the dog was missing an arm, but then he decided to kick him just because of his arm. I felt mad at the boy because he treated the dog wrong just because he didn't have an arm. The puppy was feeling happy because his owner actually got up and played with him at the end. The boy was feeling happy because the puppy found the ball and the boy thought that the dog was fine because it was tripping over the ball. I felt happy because the owner and the dog got along just because of the differences in the limbs.","NDARMM326JCB":"No. The boy was playing video games, and then his mom came home with a package. She put it down and so the boy opened it, and it was a dog with three legs instead of four. So, he put the dog down and just went back to playing, then the dog brought him a ball and he kicked it away. And then the dog, he watched the dog struggle to try to get in and then he thought it was fun, so then he got his crutches and went outside, and he only had one leg. So, that's it, and they started playing catch. Not really. That the boy and the dog were similar. It was kind of shocking at the end that the boy had one leg instead of two. That the boy first neglected the dog, and that's it. His mother. The dog. Playing video games. The ball. They are each missing one leg. Excited and happy. Happy. Kind of happy. At first ... oh wait, I was happy. Sad. Mad. I felt sorry for the dog. Still sad. I think the boy was still sad, too. Still sorry for the puppy. Very happy. Happy, too. Happier.","NDARWG798MJG":"I have not. So there is a boy that was playing video games at his house, and his mom came in, and the boy was not really paying attention to her and kind of annoying her. And she dropped this box down. And he kind of just let it sit there for a few minutes, and then he opened it up, and there was a puppy inside. And he was really happy and wowed for a moment. And then he realized that the puppy only had three legs, and he was angry and depressed kind of, and he kind of kicked it and dropped it away.                     Then the puppy kept trying to play with him, and was just doing very childish things, and he started kind of growing on the boy. And there was this red ball that the puppy was going for, and he tried to get it and he tried to get the boy to throw it for him. So the boy started trying to throw it to him, and the boy was like, \"All right, I should take you outside. This isn't enough room.\" So he gets up, and the big reveal is that he also is missing a leg.\n I mean like vivid, not ... I mean like they go outside in the end, nothing really. I thought the twist was really good at the end, and I thought it was heart-wrenching and just well-animated. I thought it was great. I mean there's things like I would dislike, but nothing that wasn't intentional. His mom, I'm guessing. A puppy. Playing video games. A red ball. They both were missing a leg. Both. Excited and very happy probably to be out of the box and see someone new. Really happy and really excited, cause he's probably wanted a puppy. I thought it was really awesome, like oh this is really cool, cause I thought it would be some kind of twist until like kids getting outside. I think the puppy didn't really ... wasn't defeated, was a little sad that he threw him, but I don't think he was too angry, and was still in a very happy mood. Angry that it had three legs. I thought the kid was kind of a douche bag, to say the truth, and was just kind of someone I don't wanna be friends with, or someone that really reads a book by its cover. I think the puppy was more defeated, but still was kind of in a mood like, all right, this is fine. I'm okay with this. I'm just gonna keep trying and be myself. Even more angry, sort of kicked him back, and he's like, all right, I just wanna play my video games, ignore this thing. A little bit more depressed, same feelings, just up a little bit more. Very happy, excited, and probably a little bit like, \"I'm finally outside, and this is what I thought was gonna happen in the beginning.\" More excited, and more accepting, more ... I was very like, whoa, I did not expect that coming for the twist at the end, and also just happy. And I thought it was a good ending when I saw the ending.","NDARZJ016GL0":"The last one? Like the small one? No. So, first, there was a boy and he was playing video games. Then his mom came home and she put a box on the coffee table, and then he was still focused on his video game. And then she got a call, or she went to the kitchen first, then she got a call, and she went upstairs, and then he looked inside the box. And then a puppy jumped out and then he thought it was cute at first, but then when he saw it didn't have a leg, then he didn't like him, which was mean.                     Then, the puppy saw a ball and he took the ball and then started playing with it. Then he gave the ball to the boy, and the boy went outside and he, actually also, was missing one of his legs. So then, him and the boy, he told his mom he was going to be outside and then they played fetch.\n No. At the end, when they got along. When the boy liked him, liked the dog. That he was addicted to video games and that he didn't like the dog because he lost one of his legs. The mom. The puppy. Playing video games. A red ball. They both lost a leg. Mm-hmm (affirmative). Excited. Excited, too. Happy, I guess. Sad, I guess. Disgusted. Disappointed. Like I forgot the word for it, but it's ... I don't know, like ... I forgot the word. But, I guess, like the boy no, he was sad, I guess. Disgusted. Mad, I guess, too. Happy. Happy, too. Happy.","NDARZJ460RWZ":"No. I heard about it though. Telling me, can you tell me what happened to would be try to tell the whole story. Remember, stories have a beginning and ending. Things that happened and an ending.                     All right. So I know what it's about, it's about this boy got a dog, and dog with one leg, like one leg missing. And I kinda realize, and then when he stands up at the park I realized that he was missing a leg too, so they kinda got similarities. And the present was a dog in a box. So he was like starting off him playing with his Xbox, I memorized the controller because I have one. So, and then it was just, there was stuff for coming, he opens his box, the dog's in it, the dog's missing one leg, and so they go out on the park and then he plays some sort of like fetch, and he throws the ball, and it was kinda funny the dog went like running and then tripping, and then running and tripping. I mean I wouldn't blame him for only having three legs, but it was like he had to hop and one leg's like this, a cane. I don't know how that happened. \n Hmm, it's dog was like a yellowish, beige kinda like this. Yeah. I thought it was really cute about that the dog and the boy having similarities because you don't usually see a kid like that, with all this missing in his knee up here. And the dog was really cute, I almost like ... I don't know, it was really cute and it was a really good movie when I saw a little bit of it. I couldn't really say anything else, because I thought it was a pretty good movie so far. I really thought it was, I don't really think about anything else. His mom. Dog. Playing the Xbox. Ball. They're both missing a leg. All right. That guy was not in the tube. Happy. Happy, until he realizes the leg is missing in the movie. But he still liked him. The dog really made me feel adorable, it was so adorable I thought. Real. Why is it pausing? Happy, like he was enjoying. Maybe somewhat now, like somewhat happy, somewhat like , I remember when the dog went like ugh, his leg was missing. But remember he, his leg's missing too. I still thought the dog was adorable. I really do, I just can't stop thinking about the dog, it was just adorable. Look it's the Xbox controller. Maybe wanting to play maybe, cause he kept coming to him? He was just like focusing on the game like just on Xbox nonstop. He wasn't really looking at the dog or playing with it. If I got a dog, I wanted a dog since I was like four or three. If I got one I would of jumped and I would of like jumped , I would have been so excited I tell you. Even if it was missing a leg I would still be happy. I do feel like watch the clip.                     I feel like the, I felt kinda, I feel like happy, number one cause the guy got a dog, I mean who can say that? The dog with the missing leg. I mean like, it's like who cares if it's a missing leg, I mean he's still alive, he's still adorable ... and the boy was getting confused and then I realized, then I think he realized that he was missing a leg, and then you're trying again, trying to get along. \n Look, see what I mean? How does the dog run like that? Cause look, he's playing fetch. Happy, because he could play fetch at the end. Happy, I felt like that. At least somewhat ... interesting and wondering of some sort.                     How did you feel when you watched the clip, did we do that already?\n I don't know, I feel like this was all I could say that this was a really good clip of the movie definitely.","NDARGF367KVL":"I've not. So, this kid was playing video games, he got a dog who did not have a leg from his mom. He kinda like shook him off and towards the end of it we find out that he also doesn't have a leg. I found that ironic there. They played ball and the dog had trouble walking and stuff. I liked how they ended up liking each other at the end, I think. And the dog was really cute and it was pretty ironic at the beginning. How the person without ... how he kinda pushed the dog off and stuff. I didn't like that at first but then I found out he also doesn't have a leg but still he shouldn't be pushing the dog off. I don't know. The mom. The dog. He was playing video games. The ball. They both didn't have a leg, a limb? They were both missing a leg, yeah. Excited for the new owner. He at first liked the dog. I felt like happy. Pretty down but I think he kinda ignored it afterwards. The boy felt really annoyed too. Kinda mad. Squealed at first but he kinda brushed that off too. He was forgiving. Still mad and ungrateful. Mad again like how the boy was so ungrateful for what he got. Happy. They were both feeling happy that they both could relate. Happy for them both.","NDARBM839WR5":"No. I didn't really enjoy it, I ... Well, it starts out with this boy. He's playing video games. And then his mom comes in and gives him a box. In the box is a puppy with three legs. And then he's annoyed by it. And eventually he's like, \"Okay, I'll, I'll ... \" and it turns out he lost half his leg. And that's basically all I saw. That's really all I remember. So- I don't like or dislike anything. It was really just meh. I don't, I already told you. I really didn't like or dislike anything. It was really just meh. His mom. A 3-legged puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They both lost half a leg. Nice. I guess a little . I was just like, \"Meh, meh, meh, meh\". Bad. A little . Yeah. Again, meh. I was pretty much meh throughout the whole movie. Puppy felt bad. Boy felt angry. I was pretty much meh throughout the whole entire movie. Good. Good. Still meh.","NDARAC904DMU":"No. There was a kid who all he did was play video games and his mom brought in a box with a dog in it that didn't have a leg and he thought it was disgusting and he just threw it on the floor. And he didn't really care about it and then he realized that the dog was tripping and kept getting stuck. And then he walked outside with the dog and then he didn't have a leg so he started playing with the dog. No. I liked how his emotions changed from the beginning to the end of the movie because first he started out really he didn't want the dog at all, he thought it was stupid and disgusting, and then towards the end he really, really liked it. I didn't like how in the beginning he was being so mean to the dog because I personally love dogs so much and I never want anyone to ever hurt them. His mother. A dog with no leg. He was playing video games. A red ball that he found under a dresser. They both don't have a leg or a body part or something. Loved because someone was actually being nice to him and caring about him. Happy that he got a new pet or something. I thought that I was really nice because I liked how he was being really nice to the dog. Hated because he just threw him on the floor because he didn't have a leg. Angry because he thought he was getting a real dog with all four of his legs and then he only had three. I felt like really angry because I didn't want anyone hurting any type of animal. He seemed kind of happy but I think he realized that nobody was really being nice to him so I think he was feeling a little hated. Angry that the dog wouldn't stop annoying him, or annoyed. I felt the same as before, I did not feel good because I love animals and I don't want anybody hurting any animals. I think he was finally feeling like he related to someone or something because he knew that someone else knew what it felt like to not have a leg or a body part. I think he started to get used to the dog and started really liking it and being really happy. I felt really happy because he finally really liked the dog and he related to him.","NDARJA157YB3":"I hope you enjoyed that last movie. Have you seen it before? Yeah?  what happened in that movie and try to tell the whole story and start from the beginning, go to the middle and to the end? Do you remember anything else in the story or is that it? So, what are some of the things you like about that movie? So, what are some of the things you did not like about that movie? And who gave the box to the boy? And what was in the box? And what was the boy doing before he was handed the box? And what was the puppy playing. So, how were the puppy and the boy the same? Now, we're just gonna watch a short clip from that again, then we'll talk about it, okay? Happy. Excited. Amazed, in a way. Kind of happy. Confused. Angry. Angry. Confused, I think, again. Angry, again. Angry. Happy. Happy, too. Happy.","NDAREV601CE7":"No, not really! I didn't even see trailers of it! What day did it come out? So this kid that I don't ... That had two legs ... He had ... His mom bought him ... He was playing video games and his mom bought him a dog. That dog only had three legs ... And one of his legs is gone so the kid that I thought had two legs only had one leg. They were both disabled. He didn't know ... He didn't want to play with the dog at first until the dog started playing around with the red ball. Then the dog got stuck in the box, then he got himself out. Then the kid noticed and he told his mom he was going outside to play with the dog. So then he played catch with the dog. I saw an Xbox 360 controller. He was playing a video game. I don't know that video game. I know a lot of video game sounds. How the disabled boy meets a disabled dog. I guess it would be the disabled dog. Not that much because  I was ... I didn't even know like ... The minute I noticed it, I was like \"Wow! What's wrong with that dog?\" I'm tying my shoes. The mother. The disabled dog. Yeah. He was playing video games. His puppy was playing with the ball. The red ball. Isn't that the same clip? You can see the disabled dog without his arm. The puppy was feeling excited that he got to see his new owner. He was excited at first until he saw the disabled  like, \"What's wrong with that dog?\" I noticed it the minute ... The second I saw him open the box, like you could ... Show the movie again.  Like if you could see from the computer, you could see the disabled dog without his leg. I was shocked! About that movie or about another one? Yeah, you can clearly see that ... You can clearly see that that ... That he was trying to push the ... That he pushed the dog away because he noticed that he only had three legs. He was so excited. He was disgusted. I felt surprised and disgusted at the same time. You can see the 360 controller right there. The puppy was  that he hated him. That the owner kid hated him so he kept trying and trying to get him to play with him. No. No. No. Didn't want to play. I just started blankly. The last clip. The last ... Ending of ... The Present. The puppy was feeling so excited that his owner finally noticed him. The boy was happy because he felt like a connection between both of them since they're alike. I felt like I was going to cry. Because that is just so sad! The fact that those two are disabled. Both of them! It symbolize them!","NDARWJ621JRZ":"No. Okay. A boy was playing video games, and then his mom came with a box. He kept on playing video games for a long time, and then he finally opened the box while the mom was on her phone walking upstairs. Then there was a dog with three legs, he didn't have one leg. He was walking around and the boy kept on kicking the dog, putting the dog away. Then he through the ball at the dog and he thought the dog was kind of funny so he went outside with the dog, and he had one leg too. Then he threw the ball and the dog was playing. Not really. That the boy and the dog were the same kind of thing. They both had a leg off. Nothing. The mom. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. They have one leg off. Both. Happy. Excited. Good. Mad. Mad. Not so good. Sad. Annoyed. It was bad. Happy. Happy. Good because they got along.","NDARAV519RND":"Not really that much though, so not really the best time. Yeah, one time. In the movie, a kid was playing a video game and then his mom came and told him she got a present for him. So after, he opened it, and then he saw a dog and the dog had three arms and three hands ... No, no four arms but three hands because one of his arms didn't have a hand, I think it was. And then he got mad for some reason. And then he just dropped the dog. I don't know why. And then he just continued playing video games and then the dog saw a ball, a red ball, under a table. So then he tried to get it and then he got it. And then he tried to give the ball to his owner, the kid. And then he kept on falling since he didn't have all of his hands or arms, I think. I don't know. And then after three falls, he finally gets there and then the kid decided to play with him. And then they went either outside in the backyard, maybe? I don't know. And then he threw the ball and the dog got it and that was it. Okay. The kid was kind of like the dog since he didn't have his full leg, or something like that. I don't know why. Not really anything. The whole thing itself. I kind of thought it was boring. Then again, it's supposed to be a bit short. A bit short. His mom. I do not think it was a Pug. A dog of some sort. Playing a video game. The red ball that was under the table. The puppy doesn't have a full leg and the boy doesn't have a full leg. Both. What? What kind of clip is that? No, no I meant why did it look like there were cubes? Pretty happy. Pretty happy. Probably a bit sad for a couple of seconds until he saw the red ball. And then he was pretty happy again. Pretty sad, maybe mad. Or maybe both. Probably a bit sad for a second. And then he tries to get the ball I think now? I told you. Probably a bit sad for a couple of seconds because then he looks like he's happy when he finds the ball. Probably mad. The same. A bit tired. That's what he said! Looks like he had a pet giraffe before. Happy and the boy was feeling happy too. The same, tired.","NDARHR372GJ7":"Yeah, I actually saw it on YouTube once. The mom brought a dog that didn't have a leg and the kid didn't have a leg. At first, the kid was ignoring the dog, but then he started to like him. Not really. The last one? That he started to like the dog after he hated him. It was kind of short. It could have been longer. His mom. The dog. He was playing his video game. A ball. 'Cause they both don't have a leg. They both were. Happy. Happy. Happy. Disappointed. Angry. Disappointed. He was still feeling happy, because he just wanted to get his attention. He didn't want to be bothered.

And at first he didn't like it and then he played with it and he liked it. He was happy. And that's how ... That's it. No, no. I don't really know because it's short. It was a short movie. I don't really know because it was so short. His mom. A dog. Playing video games. A ball. They're both missing a limb. Mm-hmm (affirmative). Happy. Happy too. I don't really know. I think happy still. A little angry. I don't know really. A little upset probably. Angry still. It's had to think because it's so short. So I don't really know. Happy. Happy. It's so hard to think because it's so short, so it's ... I don't really know.","NDARBU730PN8":"No. So, there was a boy, who was, like, obsessed with his video games. Then his mom came home one day, and she put a box on the table. He opened it, and there was a dog in it. He saw that the dog was missing a leg. The dog started doing funny things. He finally decided to throw the ball to the dog. Then he went out ... Then he stood up, and he went to the door to go outside with the dog. That's when I realized that the boy also had ... realized that he was so upset that the dog had one too. No. I like the ending. It was good to see that he liked the dog. Usually people won't like something cause it's not perfect, so. I'd like it to be longer so I just know what happened after. The boy's mother. A dog. He was playing video games. A ball. They're both missing, like, a leg, or him ... It was excited. He was also excited. I don't know. It was like ... It was kinda surprising that it popped out. And I was like ... I don't know. Like a little bit upset that he was pushed on the floor. He was mad that he saw that the dog had the same thing as him. A little bit sad that they both had a disability. A little bit determined. He was trying to make the boy like him and have fun, even though he was being pushed. He was mad that ... He was still mad about the dog. I felt bad for the dog that he was being kicked around. Happy that the boy had the same thing as him, so he finally had someone else. Happy that he also had someone else, or something else that had the same thing. Happy that they both got along finally.","NDAREF893ZM8":"Mm-hmm (affirmative). I have. Okay. So what happened was ... there was this criminal. His name's Gru and he wanted to be... Oh. So what happened was there was this boy and he was like, playing video games and he, like, didn't want to go outside. Then he found ... and then he like, his mom got him for a present ... he got a dog that only had three legs and then, at first he wasn't interested in the dog, and then eventually he got up and I realized that he only had one leg. So then he went outside and then he started playing with the dog. That's really it. Well, it's probably like, a lot of kids have actually had that happen to them, where like, they're playing video games all the time and they go outside and then eventually they get a pet and then they finally go outside. Well, I didn't like that it was short. I wish that it was longer. That's really it. His mom. A three-legged dog. Playing a violent video game. A ball. A red ball. They are, they both are missing one leg. And yeah. The puppy is probably happy to see the kid. At first interested, but then not really. I felt happy. Sad. Angry. Kind of disgusted. Like sad, and like rejected. Angry. Once again, like disgusted. Probably happy. Happy as well. Happy. Yeah.","NDARPW786GC4":"The puppy interview? Yeah. I saw it, like a couple of time. Like, my mom was on Facebook or something, and she saw this very cute puppy video, so she showed it to me. So, it was about this boy playing video games, and his mom gave her a puppy that was in an accident, or was born with something wrong with it. And, it only had three legs, because it lost its fourth leg. And, the boy didn't want a puppy that was weird. But, then at the end of the video, it showed that the boy lost his leg, too, probably in an accident, or like, he was born like that. The puppy wanted to play with him. But he didn't. That it's okay to be yourself. To tell you truth, that'd be like the lost body parts or something. The mom. A puppy with three legs, only. Playing video games, like, Call of Duty, or something. A ball. Because they both lost a leg. Both. Happy. Well, at first he was happy until he- Happy. That they thought that he was gonna accept the puppy through the whole entire video. . A little bit sad. Disappointed. I would say animal cruelty, like, animal abuse, because you don't just throw a puppy, that's abusive. Kinda positive to get the boy to look at him. Angry and disappointed. That I think he's still doing a bit of abusing, because he's, like, kicking the puppy, and you're not supposed to do that. Happy. Proud. I feel, like a bit proud, because the boy was proud that someone else is like him.","NDARFG027BT5":"No. The last movie was short. I only saw a little bit of it. In which one? Oh, but I only saw a little bit. That was the whole movie? Okay. There was a boy and he was playing video games. Then his mom gave him the present. He saw that the dog didn't have a hand over here. He had a missing leg. So they started playing together. No. But I do know they were playing with a red ball. When he saw that the dog didn't have a hand over here, he threw the dog on the floor. His mom. The dog. Playing video games. The red ball. They both have a missing part of their body. The puppy. I mean, both. Happy. Excited. Happy. Sad. Disgust, because he said \"Ugh.\" I felt bad for the dog. Even more sad. Mad. I felt like the boy was being mean to the dog. Happy. Happy. Happy.","NDARMN376BMF":"No I hadn't. So, um, a kid was playing video games and his mom came home with a box. He was annoyed because she put the box down in front of him. Then she told him to stop playing the game and to open up the box to see what she had gotten for him. He opened up the box and saw a puppy inside and when he picked it up he saw that it was missing one leg. So, when he put it down, he actually threw it down because he was annoyed with it. Um, and then when it wanted his attention he kicked it to the side. Um, then he threw a ball for it and he got, um, he smiled as it, um, as it tripped like over the ball and ran back to him. Um, and eventually after ... After doing that for a little bit he, um, stopped playing with the video game. Um, stood up and he grabbed his ... Arm supports, I think? Things that helped him walk, because he had one of his legs amputated from the knee down. So then he went outside to play with the dog. Um, no ... Yeah, no. Well that he realized that he shouldn't have been hurting the dog and he stopped. That he hurt the dog. His mom. A puppy. Playing video games. A ball. They both were missing leg. Both. Okay. Happy. Happy, I guess. I didn't really hear what he was saying because it was loud in there. Happy. Hurt. Annoyed. Bad, because he threw a puppy. Hurt, again. Annoyed, again. Bad. Okay. They were both happy. Yeah. Happy as well.","NDARKT811ATJ":"No. A kid was playing a video game and mom came home late and he was just playing video games. And then the mother said, \"Why don't you quit playing video games and open my gift?\" And he just opened the gift and then there was a dog in there and it jumped out and it wanted to play. That's all I know. No. When the mother gave the gift. When the guy was just playing video games and not opening the box. The mother. A dog. He was playing video games. A ball. I don't know. What do you mean? No. What? Okay. Great. Good. I felt like they were happy together. Sad. Mad. Sad. Sad. Mad. Sad. Okay. Happy. Happy too. Happy too. The dog. Yeah.","NDARZK732FZ0":"No. Well there's two movies though. Which one? Wait, what's the question? What's the question? Oh well, a kid, he got a dog with one leg. And he was like disappointed and didn't want it, because it was like disabled. And it started wanting to play with him, and he kept like banging the stuff, and eventually he felt bad. So, he decided to start playing with him, and turns out he also had one leg, too. So ... I guess that's what happened. No. It was like pretty short. Like, wasn't it five minutes? What I liked? ... I guess I like the dog. Because he was like ... I don't know, just like a little ... I didn't really like the kid that much, cause he was like rejecting the dog, and he was like being kinda mean to it. So I didn't like that. His mom. The dog. He was playing video games. A ball. Well they both are missing a body part. Okay. I think he was feeling happy, because he's finally out of the box. And he has like a family. Well he was happy too, when he saw the dog. I guess kinda happy. Well, like sad because he just threw him on the floor, so ... He was kinda angry, because the dog is missing a leg. A little bit angry, cause he just threw a dog on the floor, so ... I guess still sad, cause he just got kicked. He's getting annoyed at the dog. Kinda like angry at the kid, cause he kicked the dog, and yeah ... Happy cause he's finally playing with him? I guess he's finally like ... He kinda like feels bad for the dog because like they're both missing a body part, and he can like kinda relate. So ... Pity I guess? I was like kinda surprised, cause I didn't know he was missing a leg, and I guess happy for them.","NDARJF579EH9":"Yes. So in the beginning the kid was playing video games and his mom came home with a box, and then she tried to get his attention for him to open up her gift that she was giving to him and then he opened it. He finally paused his game and he opened up the box and he saw a puppy, so he was shocked about it because it seemed that he wasn't expecting one, but then he pulled the puppy out and saw that it only had three legs. He was disgusted by that so then he just threw the puppy to the side, but it seemed that the puppy was already used to having three legs so then he was fine with it and he just kept playing. Every time he fell, he would get back up. Then the boy started seeing that and finding it actually nice and funny. So then the puppy was playing catch with the ball.                     Then I think the puppy gave courage to the little boy and he got it up and then it showed that the boy also only had one leg and he was on crutches so it seems like his mom got him a puppy that related to him to show him that it shouldn't be something that you just ... that you shouldn't be ashamed of. The puppy got him out of the house where it was like in the beginning it seemed that the boy just sat home and played video games all day.\n I remember that the mom was on the phone and then it kind of seemed ... originally when I had first seen I didn't never noticed this, but the second time around it looked like the mom was limping up the stairs too. I don't know if that was part of it but ... I liked how the puppy showed the boy that he can't just quickly give up, so it gave him courage and I liked that. I think I ... I liked pretty much a lot of it. Maybe that the mom wasn't really there, didn't really see his reaction at first and see how it brought him up afterward. Maybe if she was there it would have been a little bit different. The mom. A three-legged puppy. Playing video games. A red ball. The puppy is missing a leg and so is the boy. Both. The puppy seemed happy that he was having an owner maybe. The boy was like, \"Oh, wow. Cool. That's nice.\" I felt happy for him. Probably sad. Angry and also sad. I think the boy was showing that he under-appreciates his mom because it seems like his mom went out of the way to get a puppy that was also missing a leg, so then he was like, \"Oh, she's got to be kidding me.\" It was kind of like, \"Come on.\" Disappointed. Disgusted. Kind of sad. Happy. Happy. Happy.","NDARTF133LLM":"Yes. So, there was this boy that lost his leg, then his mom came home with a surprise and then she left the surprise on the table. She said it was for him.                     He stopped playing video games, he opened the box, it was a dog. The dog had a broken leg too. He didn't like it so, he just threw him off the table. Then, the dog saw this red ball. He started taking it and started giving it to him but the boy didn't want to play with him so he threw it and the dog got it. Then, he lost it, then the guy laughed, the boy laughed but he tried to not to, so then, he actually liked the dog, so he took the ball and the dog and him went outside.\n One thing I liked about that movie was that the boy didn't want to like the dog but didn't want him to know that he didn't like the dog. That I did not like about that movie that the boy was being mean. The mom. A dog. He was playing video games. The ball. They both have two broke...one broken leg. Happy. Sad. Well happy. Happy. Sad. Mad. Normal. He was feeling hurt and the boy was feeling mad. Normal. He was feeling happy. Happy. Happy.","NDARUW000ALJ":"No. I haven't. Yeah. What movie? The boy lost a leg. Oh, I know. He have a dog who lost an arm. What I liked about the movie is when the boy starts to like the dog. What I don't like about the movie is how the boy lost a leg. His mom. A puppy. He was playing video games. He was playing with the ball. Because they want to be friends. Yeah. Happy. Nervous. I felt cool. Sad. Angry. Hurtful. Upset. Angry. Hurtful.
